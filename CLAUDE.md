# node-realtime-starter

A stampable starter repo for multiplayer web games and SaaS apps. Express backend, Next.js frontend, MongoDB, tRPC, better-auth, Stripe, WebSocket support.

## Hatchkit Context

This starter is normally generated and maintained by `hatchkit`.
If `.hatchkit.json` exists at the project root, treat the repo as a
Hatchkit-managed project.

Useful Hatchkit commands from inside a generated project:

```bash
hatchkit overview --json                 # inspect manifest/project state
hatchkit update                          # add supported features additively
hatchkit add <project> [services]        # provision GlitchTip/OpenPanel/Plausible/Listmonk+SES/S3/email/search
hatchkit keys push <project>             # push dotenvx private key to Coolify/GitHub Actions
hatchkit sync                            # sync/deploy existing project state
hatchkit rename-domain                   # update domain-related deploy config
hatchkit regen-infra                     # regenerate infra/deploy files
hatchkit provision s3                    # create project buckets + env entries
hatchkit assets pull                     # mirror remote object storage assets locally
```

Newsletter / Listmonk + SES smoke commands (run from the project root
once `hatchkit add <project> listmonk-ses` has populated env):

```bash
pnpm newsletter:verify              # full smoke — API reach, list ids, subscriber, real tx send
pnpm newsletter:test-tx             # send one /api/tx email to LISTMONK_TEST_RECIPIENT
pnpm newsletter:welcome             # send emails/welcome.html to LISTMONK_TEST_RECIPIENT
pnpm newsletter:draft emails/digest-sample.html --subject "Issue 1"   # stage digest as a Listmonk draft
NODE_ENV=production pnpm newsletter:send emails/digest-sample.html --subject "..." --confirm   # real broadcast
```

Hatchkit auto-subscribes your default forwarding email onto
`<project>-test` and writes it to `.env.development` as
`LISTMONK_TEST_RECIPIENT`, so the smoke scripts work end-to-end on a
fresh provision with no extra setup.

Before giving Hatchkit setup advice, run `hatchkit status --json` and
read `providers[]`, `nextStep`, and `suggestions[]`. For provider failures,
run `hatchkit doctor --json` and surface the failing `checks[].hint[]`
lines. Never print dotenvx private keys unless the user specifically asks.

If a Hatchkit command breaks in this project, report the failing command,
cwd, Hatchkit version, output, suspected source area, and safe undo path.
When asking another agent to fix it, include a repair prompt with those details
and tell it to preserve existing user setups, use `--dry-run` where possible,
and ask before provider/DNS/Coolify/Terraform/keychain mutations.

Do not run commands that may alter existing infrastructure unless the user
explicitly asks. Prefer giving the command to the user, or using preview modes
such as `hatchkit destroy <project> --recipe`, `hatchkit gh-pages --undo
--dry-run`, and other command-specific `--dry-run` options.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Express + TypeScript, tRPC for typed API, better-auth for authentication, Stripe for payments
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui, tRPC React Query client
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose) + Redis (ioredis)
- **Real-time:** Native `ws` WebSocket on same Express process
- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces — `packages/server`, `packages/client`, `packages/shared`

## How to Run

```bash
pnpm install                          # install all dependencies
pnpm run dev:infra                    # start MongoDB, Redis, local S3 (Docker, one-time)
pnpm run seed:assets                  # populate local S3 from seed/assets/ (idempotent)
pnpm run dev                          # client 3392, server 5159, docs 4000
pnpm run dev:auto                     # same, but every port auto-picked
pnpm run dev:fixed                    # the pinned ports, or fail — never a fallback
```

Two dev commands, because the two callers want opposite things:

- **`pnpm run dev`** pins **client 3392, API 5159, docs 4000** (`DEV_*_PORT` in
  `scripts/dev.mjs`). The origins never move, so password managers, saved logins
  and bookmarks keep working — and so do the clients that bake the API URL in at
  build time (browser extension, Raycast, desktop/mobile), none of which can
  follow a port that changes per run.
- **`pnpm run dev:auto`** auto-picks every port. Use it for agents and for any
  second instance, so nothing fights over the pinned three.

`pnpm run dev` inside a git worktree behaves like `dev:auto` automatically, so
several agents can run side by side without stepping on the main checkout. A
worktree therefore does NOT serve the ports the extension and Raycast default
to — point them at the printed ports, or run `dev:fixed` there when the worktree
is the thing being tested.

`PORT`, `API_PORT` and `DOCS_PORT` pin individual ports, and `--fixed` wins over
all of it, worktree included. If a pinned port is busy, `dev` warns and falls
back to a random one for that run rather than refusing to start; `dev:fixed`
exits instead, because "these exact ports" was the point. `node scripts/dev.mjs
--dry-run` resolves and prints ports without starting anything.

`dev` also derives the dev browser extension's `chrome-extension://<id>` origin
from `packages/extension/dist`'s absolute path — the same hash Chrome uses — and
passes it to the server as `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, so no id is ever pasted by hand
for local work. Anything in `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in the environment is kept
alongside it. Production origins belong in the server app's `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
field in Coolify — `.env.production` is untracked here and never reaches the
image.

Drop fixtures into `seed/assets/` to have them auto-populate the
local bucket — see `seed/README.md`. To copy a real-prod bucket into
local for realistic dev data, `hatchkit assets pull` (treat the copy
as production data — same handling rules apply).

## How to Test

```bash
pnpm run test:unit                    # server unit tests (node:test)
pnpm run test:client                  # client unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm run test:e2e                     # Playwright E2E tests
pnpm run build                        # build all packages
```

## Desktop (Electron or Tauri) + Mobile (Capacitor)

All native targets wrap the Next.js client as a **static export** (`output: "export"`).
The Express server is always remote — the client talks to it over HTTPS.

There are two desktop wrappers — a project has at most one:

- **Electron** (`desktop` feature) — the default for apps.
- **Tauri** (`desktop-tauri` feature) — for games: much smaller binaries,
  Steamworks integration via the Rust side. See `src-tauri/README.md`.

### Desktop (Electron)

```bash
pnpm dev:desktop                      # Next dev + Electron window, HMR recovery
pnpm build:desktop                    # static export + compile electron/
pnpm electron:build                   # electron-builder → dmg/zip/exe/AppImage
pnpm icons:desktop                    # regenerate icns/ico/png set (electron-icon-builder; cross-platform)
```

`build/icon.png` is generated — run `pnpm icons:brand` to re-derive it (and
every other shipped bitmap) from `packages/client/public/brand/mark-tile.svg`,
then `pnpm icons:desktop` to fan it out to icns/ico. Do not hand-edit it.
Bundle config lives in root `package.json` `"build"` (electron-builder).
Electron IPC bridge: `electron/preload.ts` exposes `window.electronAPI`.

### Desktop (Tauri + Steamworks)

Requires the Rust toolchain (https://rustup.rs).

```bash
pnpm dev:tauri                        # Next dev + Tauri window, HMR
pnpm build:tauri                      # static export + native bundle (dmg/msi/AppImage)
pnpm icons:tauri                      # regenerate src-tauri/icons/ from build/icon.png
pnpm tauri build -- --features steam  # Steam-enabled build (needs Steamworks SDK redistributable)
```

Bundle config lives in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (strict JSON — no
comments; caveats documented in `src-tauri/README.md`). Steam init is
gated behind the `steam` cargo feature in `src-tauri/src/main.rs` — set
`STEAM_APP_ID` there before shipping.

### Mobile

```bash
pnpm cap:add:ios                      # one-time — requires Xcode
pnpm cap:add:android                  # one-time — requires Android Studio / SDK
pnpm dev:ios                          # live-reload on Simulator
pnpm dev:android                      # live-reload on emulator/device
pnpm build:mobile [ios|android]       # build + verify + cap sync, as one step
pnpm mobile:assets                    # generate icons/splash from resources/
pnpm build:android:release            # AAB for Play Store
pnpm build:ios:release                # opens Xcode for App Store archive
```

`ios/` and `android/` are both **committed** — the ATS exception, the
orientation set, the debug-only cleartext config, `versionName` and (later)
entitlements and signing are hand-edits that live only in those trees, and a
fresh checkout has to build the real app without a generator run.
`.github/workflows/mobile-release.yml` also assumes both trees exist while
never running `cap add`.

What `cap add` *does* write, contrary to a note that survived several stages
here: `@capacitor/cli` 8.3.4 calls `editProjectSettingsIOS` /
`editProjectSettingsAndroid` right after extracting the template
(`dist/tasks/add.js`), so `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`, `CFBundleDisplayName`,
`namespace`, `applicationId` and `res/values/strings.xml` all come out correct.
It writes them **once**: `cap sync` never revisits them, so a later change to
`appId` or `appName` in `capacitor.config.ts` silently does not reach the
native trees. That is the drift `scripts/build-mobile.mjs` asserts against, for
both platforms, along with `MARKETING_VERSION` / `versionName` versus the root
`package.json`.

Generated-but-tracked inside them: `ios/App/CapApp-SPM/Package.swift`,
`android/capacitor.settings.gradle` and `android/app/capacitor.build.gradle`,
all rewritten by every `cap sync` (a diff there after a build is normal —
commit it when the plugin set changed), plus the `Assets.xcassets` catalog and
the Android `res/` icon and splash sets, regenerated by `pnpm mobile:assets`
from `resources/`. Not tracked, and regenerated by the same sync: the copied
web assets (`ios/App/App/public`, `android/app/src/main/assets/public`) and
`android/capacitor-cordova-android-plugins/`. A checkout that has never run
`pnpm build:mobile` therefore cannot open in Xcode or Gradle — build first.

Two Android-only notes. Its **document origin is `https://localhost`**, iOS's
is `capacitor://localhost`; both are in the dev trust list. Never set a custom
`iosScheme`/`androidScheme` — the scheme *is* the origin, so changing it later
orphans every stored Preference and invalidates the trust list at once. And
Android blocks cleartext HTTP for `targetSdk` 28+ while Capacitor 8's Android
runtime no longer reads `server.cleartext` at all, so a dev build talking to a
local API needs `app/src/debug/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`. It is in
the **debug** source set: release builds get no cleartext exception, which is
stricter than the iOS side's `Info.plist`.

`pnpm mobile:assets` also rewrites `ios/App/App.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`,
stripping the leading zero from `LastSwiftUpdateCheck`/`LastUpgradeCheck`.
Harmless, but `git checkout` it rather than committing the churn.

`Package.swift` hardcodes pnpm's content-addressed store paths
(`node_modules/.pnpm/@capacitor+app@8.1.0_@capacitor+core@8.3.4/...`), and every
Capacitor dependency is declared as a `^8.x` range — so any lockfile refresh
renames those directories and the committed file points at paths that no longer
exist. Run `pnpm build:mobile ios` after any `pnpm install` and before opening
`ios/App` in Xcode directly, or SPM resolution fails on a checkout that has
never built.

**`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is required and baked in at build time.**
`scripts/build-mobile.mjs` refuses to run without it, and afterwards asserts the
literal is really in an emitted chunk — an unset value otherwise ships an app
that resolves every request against `capacitor://localhost`, fails on device and
builds green. It also preflights the toolchain (Xcode selected, a simulator
available, `cap ls` loading the config, every plugin shipping a `Package.swift`,
the native identifiers agreeing with `capacitor.config.ts` and `package.json`)
and warns when nothing is listening on the baked host:port.

**It syncs the platforms this machine can build, not the ones that exist.**
Both native trees are committed, so every checkout has an `android/` whether or
not it has a JDK and an SDK. A platform named on the command line
(`pnpm build:mobile android`) is a demand and a missing toolchain is an error;
an auto-detected one is an offer and a missing toolchain is skipped with a
note. So a Mac with no Android SDK, and the Linux runner with no Xcode, both
run a bare `pnpm build:mobile` without failing on the half they never wanted.

The mobile export has its own directory, `packages/client/out-mobile`, and
`capacitor.config.ts` points `webDir` at it. `out/` is written by the web build,
the Electron/Tauri shells AND Playwright (which bakes a throwaway 127.0.0.1 API
port), and `cap run` syncs implicitly — a shared directory means a test run can
silently be installed as the app. Never run bare `cap sync` / `cap run ios`;
`cap:run:*` and `build:ios:release` go through the script and then `--no-sync`.

**In a worktree**, `pnpm run dev` picks random ports, and a bundle cannot follow
a port that changes per run. Pin them and bake the same value:

```bash
API_PORT=51590 PORT=33920 pnpm run dev        # high ports, no clash with 5159/3392
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:51590 pnpm build:mobile ios
```

A dev server for the checkout owns `packages/client/.next`, which a production
build needs too (with `output: "export"` a custom `distDir` is the *out* dir and
the build dir is forced back to `.next`), so `build:mobile` refuses while one is
live. Stop it, or give dev its own with `INSTANCE_ID=<name> pnpm run dev`.

`capacitor://localhost`, `https://localhost` and `http://10.0.2.2:51740` are
trusted by `scripts/dev.mjs` directly — not via `.env.development`, whose value
dotenvx skips because the dev script already set the key in the server child's
environment. The third one is `pnpm dev:android`'s live-reload origin: under
live reload the WebView loads the Next dev server rather than the bundle, so
the document origin is the dev server's and the API must trust *that*. Only the
default port is listed; `NEXT_PORT=<n>` or a physical device on `LAN_IP` needs
`TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://<host>:<n> pnpm run dev`, which the script prints.

**Live reload is not the app.** Under `dev:ios` / `dev:android` the document
origin is the dev server's, so neither the real origin nor its place in the
trust list is exercised — verify auth changes against a `pnpm build:mobile`
bundle. Android live reload additionally needs the dev origin in Next's
`allowedDevOrigins` (Next 16 blocks cross-origin `/_next` dev resources);
`scripts/android-dev.sh` exports `NEXT_DEV_ORIGINS`, which `next.config.ts`
merges. Without it the document is served, every chunk is blocked, and the app
sits on a splash that `launchAutoHide: false` never hides.

**Verifying on the emulator without Android Studio.** `pnpm dev:android` boots
one and deploys; for a bundled build the loop is `pnpm build:mobile android`,
then `cd android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`, then `adb install -r
app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` and `adb shell am start -n
com.trebeljahr.tracktime/.MainActivity`. `adb exec-out screencap -p > shot.png`
is the screenshot. Three traps that cost real time:

- A bundled build's origin is `https://localhost`, and a fetch from an https
  document to a plain-http one is blocked as mixed content unless the target is
  a loopback address. So bake `http://localhost:<API_PORT>` and run
  `adb reverse tcp:<API_PORT> tcp:<API_PORT>`; `10.0.2.2` works for live
  reload, where the document is itself http, but not for the bundle.
- `adb shell input text` is split by the *device's* shell, so only the first
  word of "two words" arrives. Use `%s` for spaces.
- The **first** back press with a dialog open is eaten by the IME whenever a
  field is focused (`dumpsys input_method | grep mInputShown` says so), even
  with no on-screen keyboard visible because a hardware keyboard is attached.
  That is Android's own behaviour, not a bug in the overlay stack — press back
  twice, or check `mInputShown` first.

Bridge runs in `packages/client/src/mobile/bridge.ts` — lifecycle, splash,
status bar, orientation.

**What survives an OS kill, and where.** Three separate stores, on purpose:

- The **session token** is in the Keychain (`lib/native-session.ts`). It is a
  credential; Preferences is plain `UserDefaults` and readable from an
  unencrypted backup.
- The **offline queue** and the **running-timer mirror** are in Capacitor
  Preferences (`mobile/preferences-storage.ts`, `lib/running-mirror.ts`). They
  are data, and what matters is that iOS cannot evict them: WKWebView
  classifies `localStorage` as *non-critical web data* and reclaims it after
  low disk or roughly a week of not opening the app. `webStorage()` swallows
  every throw, so that loss would be silent — and what is in the queue is time
  the user tracked that no server has ever seen. The adapter hands over
  anything a pre-Preferences build left in `localStorage`, once, behind a
  marker; without that, changing the address *is* the data loss.
- Everything else (a remembered filter, the theme) stays in `localStorage`,
  where eviction costs nothing.

**Network truth comes from the radio, not the browser.** `navigator.onLine`
reports `true` on a dead radio in WKWebView and never fires for airplane mode,
so `mobile/network.ts` reads `@capacitor/network` on native and feeds one
verdict to `isOnline()`, to `useOfflineQueue`'s subscription and to React
Query's `onlineManager`. Two consequences worth knowing before touching any of
it:

- `isNetworkError()` short-circuits on `isOnline()`, so a wrong verdict decides
  whether a refused mutation is queued for replay or rolled back.
- **The mutations the offline queue owns run in `networkMode: "always"`** —
  and *only* those. React Query otherwise *pauses* a mutation while it believes
  the device is offline: `mutationFn` never runs, `onError` never fires, and
  `onError` is where `use-entry-mutations.ts` queues offline work. With the
  radio's real answer wired in, the default would make start/stop in airplane
  mode do nothing at all. The offline queue is this app's pause mechanism and
  it needs the failure to happen. The option is `OFFLINE_QUEUED_MUTATION` in
  `lib/query-client.ts`, spread into the entry mutations, the timesheet grid's
  writes and the queue's own replay; it is deliberately **not** a
  `defaultOptions.mutations`, which would take pause-and-resume away from the
  forty-odd mutations that queue nothing — on web as much as on the phone —
  and leave them toasting "network error" on a blip where they used to wait.
  Queries keep the default too, where pausing is exactly right.

**The running timer is mirrored, and the mirror is only overwritten by an
answer.** `lib/running-mirror.ts` writes every resolution of
`trpc.entries.current` to Preferences and `MobileBridgeLoader` seeds the timer
store from it at boot. `useRunningEntry` then waits for `query.isSuccess`
before touching the store: on a cold offline launch the query never answers, so
an ungated effect reads `data === undefined` as "nothing is running" and wipes
the seed on the first render — which is exactly the launch the mirror exists
for. A pending or failed read is not a statement about the timer.

**Resume order is load-bearing** (`hooks/use-native-lifecycle.ts`): reconnect,
tick, flush the queue — and refetch `entries.current` *only* when nothing was
queued. Refetching first asks a server that has never heard of the start the
user made with no signal, gets `null`, and blanks the running clock until the
flush lands. The socket is reconnected because the server pings every 10s and
drops on the first missed pong, so it is dead server-side within ~20s of every
backgrounding, while a frozen socket delivers no close event and the client
still says "open".

**The offline queue is mounted in `AppShell`**, not in `TrackerBar`. Everything
that drains it lives inside `useOfflineQueue`, so while it was mounted on
`/track` only, reconnecting on any other screen drained nothing — a plain web
bug, and a guaranteed one on a phone, which resumes on whatever screen it was
left on.

**Verifying on the Simulator without Xcode's GUI.** Build, install, launch and
screenshot from a shell:

```bash
UDID=$(xcrun simctl list devices available | grep -m1 "iPhone 17 (" | sed -E "s/.*\(([0-9A-F-]{36})\).*/\1/")
xcrun simctl boot "$UDID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:51590 pnpm build:mobile ios
cd ios/App && xcodebuild -project App.xcodeproj -scheme App -configuration Debug \
  -sdk iphonesimulator -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,id=$UDID" \
  -derivedDataPath /tmp/dd build
xcrun simctl install "$UDID" /tmp/dd/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/App.app
xcrun simctl launch "$UDID" com.trebeljahr.tracktime
xcrun simctl io "$UDID" screenshot --type=png out.png
```

Three traps in that loop, each of which produces a *working-looking* app that
is quietly wrong:

- **Do not pass `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`.** Without the ad-hoc signature
  Xcode applies by default for the simulator SDK, every Keychain call fails
  with `StorageError: An OS error occurred (-34018)`
  (`errSecMissingEntitlement`). The session token is then never stored, the app
  silently falls back to the cookie, and the bearer path looks fine while being
  entirely untested.
- **The Simulator's WKWebView does send cookies to `http://localhost:<port>`**,
  and its cookie store survives `simctl uninstall`. So cookie auth appears to
  work from `capacitor://localhost` and masks a broken bearer path — the same
  trap as `pnpm dev:ios`, one layer down. The tell is on the server: a tRPC
  request from the app must arrive with **no** `Cookie` header at all, because
  `lib/trpc.ts` switches to `credentials: "omit"` the moment a token exists.
  `xcrun simctl erase <udid>` is the only reliable clean slate.
- **Never return a Capacitor plugin handle from an `async` function.** A plugin
  handle is a Proxy that answers every property with a callable, `then`
  included, so the promise machinery adopts it as a thenable and calls
  `Plugin.then(resolve, reject)` — a bridge message for a native method nobody
  implements. It neither resolves nor rejects, and with
  `launchAutoHide: false` the app freezes on the splash with no console to
  read. Wrap the handle in a plain object; `lib/native-session.ts` does, and
  `native-session.test.ts` has the regression.
- **`simctl` alone never shows the software keyboard.** The Simulator counts
  the Mac's keyboard as connected until `Simulator.app` itself has read
  `defaults write com.apple.iphonesimulator ConnectHardwareKeyboard -bool
  false`, so a headless loop screenshots a focused field with no keyboard under
  it and nothing about the layout is being tested. Write the default, then
  `open -a Simulator` once.

**Native chrome lives in `packages/client/src/styles/native.css`**, imported by
one line from `globals.css`. Every selector in it is under `body.cap` — safe-area
padding, 16px fields, `.cap-touch`, the two-row tracker composer, the top-anchored
dialog — so it is inert on web *by construction*, and `e2e/mobile-shell.spec.ts`
(the `phone` Playwright project, `devices["Pixel 5"]`) asserts that at 393pt.
Rules that would also be right on web belong in `globals.css` instead.

`body.cap` is set twice on purpose: by an inline script at the top of `<body>`
in `app/layout.tsx`, before the first paint, and again by `mobile/bridge.ts`
after its dynamic imports resolve. The pre-paint one is what matters on a
WebView reload, which has no splash to hide the unpadded frame. `<body>`
therefore carries `suppressHydrationWarning`.

Two things that look like ordinary CSS and are not. Tailwind v4's `translate-*`
utilities compile to the `translate` **property**, so the way to undo a
`translate-y-[-50%]` is `--tw-translate-y: 0`, never a `transform` (which stacks
on top of it). And `native.css` is unlayered while Tailwind's utilities are in
`@layer utilities`, so its rules already beat them — no `!important` needed, and
adding one would only hide the fact that the cascade is doing the work.

**The bottom tab bar renders on every platform.** `components/mobile-tab-bar.tsx`
ships in the web bundle too and is `display: none` there — Tailwind's `hidden`,
undone by the one `body.cap` rule in `native.css`. It must not branch on
`isNative()`: under `output: "export"` every page is prerendered in Node, where
`window.Capacitor` cannot exist, so a tree that differs at hydration is a
mismatch React resolves by discarding the served DOM. The same argument applies
to anything else the phone shows and the web does not. Three tabs, and the third
opens the *existing* drawer with the *existing* `NAV_SECTIONS` — there is no
second list of destinations, so a new web screen reaches the phone for free.

**Native handlers are registered with `setMobileHandlers`, never through
`initMobile`.** `initMobile` latches on its first call, and that call is
`MobileBridgeLoader` at the app root — before `AppShell` exists, and on screens
where it never mounts. Handlers passed in afterwards are dropped in silence.
The `backButton` and `appStateChange` listeners are registered unconditionally
and read through a mutable table that `setMobileHandlers` fills from a React
effect; it returns its own teardown, and the teardown clears only the exact
functions it installed.

Adding a `backButton` listener also *overrides* Capacitor's default, so that
callback is the whole behaviour of the button. `event.canGoBack` is not the
signal it looks like: a single-page app accumulates history entries just by
moving between tabs, so it is nearly always true. The order is
`mobile/back-button.ts` — close the top overlay, else go to `/track`, else
return `false`, which means exit. Overlays register themselves in
`mobile/overlay-stack.ts`; dialogs do it once in `ui/dialog.tsx` rather than
eleven times, and only when controlled (an uncontrolled dialog has no
`onOpenChange`, so back would swallow the press and do nothing).

### Native client auth

Better-auth uses cookies; native shells need extra CORS/trust origins.
Set `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` on the server (comma-separated):

```
TRUSTED_ORIGINS=capacitor://localhost,https://localhost
```

Electron `file://` sends `Origin: null` and can't be trusted with
credentials. Register a custom protocol in `electron/main.ts` and add
it (e.g. `app://-`) instead.

Tauri serves the bundled frontend from `tauri://localhost` (macOS/Linux)
and `http://tauri.localhost` (Windows) — both must be in
`TRUSTED_ORIGINS` for cookie auth to work.

### The Capacitor shells do not use cookies

A `capacitor://localhost` document is cross-site to the API whatever SameSite
says, and WKWebView's tracking prevention drops the cookie sooner or later. So
the mobile shells take the same bearer path as Raycast and the extension — but
through the ordinary `/login` form rather than the device flow, because on a
phone the "second, already signed-in browser" a device flow assumes is often
the very thing being replaced.

- `lib/native-session.ts` owns the token: hydrated from the Keychain
  (`@aparajita/capacitor-secure-storage`) at boot, published as a store so
  consumers gate *behaviour* rather than the React tree — under
  `output: "export"` a component that rendered `null` while hydrating would
  disagree with the prerendered HTML.
- `lib/auth-client.ts` reads the token back on every call
  (`fetchOptions.auth`, which omits the header entirely when it returns
  `undefined`) and captures new ones from the `set-auth-token` response header.
  **Only ever store a truthy value**: the bearer plugin emits that header only
  when the response carries a session cookie, so an unconditional write erases
  a good token on the first `/get-session`.
- `lib/trpc.ts` adds `Authorization` and switches to `credentials: "omit"` when
  a token exists. With none — every web request — it is byte-identical to what
  it was, which `lib/trpc.test.ts` asserts rather than assumes.
- The socket takes the token as a **getter**, and `useSync`'s effect is keyed on
  it. The Keychain answers after mount, so a snapshot would open one tokenless
  socket, be refused, and retry that refusal forever — taking the offline
  queue's flush trigger down with it, since that fires on `syncStatus === "open"`.
- A Keychain item **outlives the app** on iOS. A `@capacitor/preferences`
  marker (which does not) is what tells a fresh install from a relaunch, so
  delete-and-reinstall means signed out rather than resuming a previous — possibly
  a previous *user's* — session.
- Session lifetime is set explicitly in `auth/auth.ts` (30 days, refreshed at
  most daily), not inherited from better-auth's 7-day default: a phone left in a
  drawer over a holiday would otherwise come back to a session row the next
  lookup deletes, and replay a day of offline-tracked time into 401s.
- An expired or revoked session **stops** the offline flush and keeps the rows
  (`isAuthError` in `lib/offline.ts`). Dropping them is the default for a server
  refusal and is right for a validation error; it is never right for "we do not
  know who you are".

### Clients without a cookie jar (Raycast, CLI, extensions)

There are no API tokens to mint or paste. Every client signs in normally
and keeps the resulting better-auth **session token**, which it sends as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` (and as the `bearer.<token>` WebSocket
subprotocol). Server side this is the `bearer` plugin in `auth/auth.ts` —
by the time `getSession()` runs, a token client and a cookie client are
indistinguishable, so there is exactly one auth path to reason about.

Use the helpers in `@starter/core` (`session-auth.ts`):

```ts
// Client shows its own sign-in form (browser extension popup):
const { token } = await signInWithPassword(
  { baseUrl, clientId: "tracktime-extension" },
  { email, password },
);

// Client cannot show a form (Raycast, CLI) — RFC 8628 device flow:
const auth = await startDeviceAuthorization({ baseUrl, clientId: "tracktime-raycast" });
// show auth.userCode, open auth.verificationUriComplete
const { token } = await pollForDeviceSession(
  { baseUrl, clientId: "tracktime-raycast" },
  auth.deviceCode,
  { intervalSeconds: auth.intervalSeconds },
);
```

A client that runs **in a browser** must have its **origin in
`TRUSTED_ORIGINS`**, or sign-in answers `403 INVALID_ORIGIN` before the password
is checked: better-auth force-validates `Origin` whenever a request carries
`Sec-Fetch-*` headers, which every real browser fetch does (curl does not —
which makes curl a misleading way to test this). An unpacked extension's id
comes from the absolute path it was loaded from; `pnpm run dev` derives it and
trusts it automatically, and `pnpm run extension:id` prints it for any other
server.

Raycast and CLIs need **no origin at all**, and have none to give: their `fetch`
sends neither `Origin` nor `Sec-Fetch-*`, and better-auth's `validateOrigin`
returns early unless the request carries cookies or those headers. What guards
them instead is the device flow — a code the user approves in an already
signed-in browser — plus the client-id allowlist in `auth/client-label.ts` and
per-session revocation in Settings → Devices.

Store that token in real secret storage (Keychain, `chrome.storage.session`,
the Raycast password store), never a plain config file. Clients send
`x-tracktime-client` so their session is named in Settings → Devices, where
any of them can be signed out. Device-flow client ids are allowlisted in
`auth/client-label.ts`.

Revocation has to reach the socket, not just HTTP. `ws/handler.ts`
authenticates at the upgrade, and a phone then holds that socket open for
days — so the session behind every live socket is re-checked once a minute
(`ws/session-watch.ts`), and one that no longer exists is dropped out of its
room and closed with code 4401. Two things there are load-bearing: the
re-check passes `disableCookieCache`, or a revoked web session keeps
answering out of the five-minute cookie cache; and a lookup that *throws* is
"unknown", never "revoked", because one bad database minute must not sign
every connected device out. A timer rather than a revoke event, because
expiry and a row deleted straight out of the database are revocations too,
and no event is published for either.

### Catalog shape

There is one hierarchy, and it is two levels deep: Client → Project. Tasks and
tags sit beside it, not under it.

A **task** is a workspace-wide name for a kind of work — "Design review",
"Invoicing" — and an entry carries a task and a project as two independent
references. Any combination is legal: both, either, neither. Nothing anywhere
infers one from the other, and deleting a project detaches its entries without
touching a single task. Folding tasks under projects meant re-creating
"Design review" once per project and made every cross-project question about
what the work WAS unanswerable.

Three places this used to leak, each of which now deliberately does nothing:

- `entries.start/create/update` validate `projectId` and `taskId`
  independently. There is no "task does not belong to the given project".
- `withProject` in `@starter/core` leaves the task alone. Changing a project
  used to clear the task in the same write.
- `cascadeDeleteProject` deletes no tasks. `CatalogRemoveResult.tasksDeleted`
  survives only for an import undo, which does delete the tasks it created.

Task documents written before this may still carry a stray `projectId`; the
strict mongoose schema drops it on read, so there is nothing to backfill. Task
names are unique per workspace rather than per project, which existing
duplicates across projects are grandfathered past — they only block a new
create or rename.

### Tags

Tags are the other catalog dimension outside the client/project hierarchy:
many per entry rather than one, so "invoicing" or "deep work" can be reported
on across every project. Entries carry `tagIds: string[]`.

Three rules that fail quietly if broken:

- **`TimeEntry.tagIds` is never `required`.** Entries written before tags
  existed have no such field, and a required array would fail validation on
  each of them the next time it was saved. (Same trap as
  `TimeEntry.description`, and as `createdBy` on the catalog models.)
- **Deleting a tag `$pull`s it off every entry** — never `$set: []` and never
  `$unset`, either of which takes that entry's *other* tags with it.
- **Tags ride alongside `QuickStart`, never inside `quickStartKey`.** Folding
  them into the key would split one recurring combination into a recent per
  set of labels, so a favorite tagged differently one day fragments the
  recents list. Quick starts therefore open untagged.

`reports.summary` with `groupBy: "tag"` gives an entry's **full** duration to
each of its tags, so the group rows deliberately sum to more than the range
total. Splitting the duration evenly would invent time nobody spent. The
overlap is real, so the table states it on screen rather than showing a
breakdown that cannot reconcile; the report's own totals stay single-counted.

Every client can set tags. The offline payload types in `@starter/core`
(`OfflineStartInput` and friends) carry an optional `tagIds`, so a tag applied
offline survives the replay from the web app, the extension or Raycast alike.
Optional, because a row queued by a build that predates tags must still decode
and replay: the server reads an absent list as "no tags" on start/create and
as "leave them alone" on update.

### Import and export

`data.analyze` / `data.commit` bring a tracked history in from a file, and
`data.exportJson` / `data.exportCsv` take a whole workspace out. Parsing lives
in `packages/server/src/services/import/` and is pure, so it is unit-tested
without a database.

Four rules, each of which fails silently if broken:

- **Column shapes, not vendors.** Headers are matched to roles by an alias
  table (`columns.ts`), and the values decide the granularity: a `Start`
  holding `2026-08-21 09:00` is a `start`, one holding `09:00` is a
  `startTime` needing a `date` beside it. Nothing anywhere names a product.
- **`analyze` and `commit` take the same input and run the same parser.** The
  preview is a description, never a token — the commit re-reads the file
  instead of trusting rows handed back to it, so a tampered preview cannot
  make it write something the user never approved.
- **Day/month order is decided per file, then stated on screen.** `03/04` is
  valid either way round, and a wrong guess moves entries by months without
  ever erroring. Any value over 12 settles it; when nothing does, the preview
  says so and the user picks (`dateOrder`).
- **Every import is a batch.** Entries carry `importId`, so undo is one
  indexed delete; the batch document lists only the catalog it created, which
  is deleted on undo only when nothing else has come to use it. A batch whose
  entries are on an invoice refuses to undo.

Files with a date and a number of hours but no clock time (`date-duration`)
get their entries stacked back-to-back from `IMPORT_DAY_START_HOUR`, in file
order, per day. The times of day are invented — the day totals are not — and
the preview says so rather than letting it pass for recorded fact.

The CSV export is written in the exact column shape the importer recognises,
so a spreadsheet round trip is supported rather than lucky. The JSON export is
the lossless one (colors, archived catalog rows, project rates) and references
the catalog **by name**, so it can be imported into a different workspace or
into an empty one after the database it came from is gone.

### Public REST API and webhooks

`/api/v1` is the token-authenticated REST surface third parties integrate
against — entries, catalog and reports, with webhooks pushing the same events
out. `docs/api.md` is the maintainer's view; `docs-site/docs/api/` is the
integrator's.

**REST never enters tRPC.** A request authenticates in `api/v1/auth.ts`, builds
a `WorkspaceScope`, and calls the same extracted services (`services/entries/`,
`services/catalog/`) the tRPC resolvers call. No synthetic context, no token
path through `workspaceProcedure`. That is what makes "a token can never name a
workspace of its own" structural rather than a rule per handler: the request
never reaches `workspaceIdFromInput` at all. It also means a REST write
publishes the same sync event and enqueues the same webhooks as a tRPC one —
nothing under `api/v1/` re-implements a business rule.

```bash
pnpm run openapi:emit                 # regenerate the two committed artifacts
```

Five rules, each of which fails quietly if broken:

- **`API_ROUTES` in `api/v1/routes-table.ts` is the only source of truth.**
  Express mounts from it and `z.toJSONSchema` builds the OpenAPI document from
  the same shared zod schemas the handlers validate with (zod 4, native — never
  add a zod-to-openapi dependency). A route not in the table is not mounted; a
  route in it with no handler throws at boot rather than 404-ing in production.
- **`docs-site/static/openapi.json` and `docs-site/docs/api/reference.md` are
  committed.** A spec regenerated at deploy time is a spec nobody reviews in a
  diff. `tests/openapi-document.test.ts` fails when either is stale.
- **A token's visibility is live, intersected with a frozen ceiling.** Revoking
  a permission narrows it on the next request; granting one never widens a
  token minted before. A removed member's token is dead — `401`, not `403`.
- **Money is projected where that is honest and refused where it is not.**
  `GET /entries*` nulls a colleague's `hourlyRate`, `GET /projects*` nulls
  `progress`, and `GET /reports/*` answers `403 money-visibility-required`
  rather than inventing a total. No invoice, CSV or PDF routes in v1, for the
  same reason. Never recompute an amount at read time.
- **Cross-workspace and foreign ids answer 404, never 403.** A 403 confirms the
  id exists somewhere. `403` is for a scope or money refusal on a resource this
  workspace genuinely owns, and every 5xx `detail` is the same fixed string in
  every environment — the global `errorHandler` returns `err.message` verbatim
  outside production, so REST answers its own errors instead of throwing into
  it.

Errors are RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`; successes are `{ data }`, with
`nextCursor` always present and `null` on a list's last page. Rate limiting is
a fixed 60s window per token (`API_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, default 600), Redis
when there is one and per-process when there is not.

Webhooks sign `HMAC-SHA256(secret, "<timestamp>.<rawBody>")` as `v1=<hex>`, over
a `rawBody` computed ONCE and handed to `fetch` unchanged — stringify it twice
and every receiver doing its job rejects the delivery as forged. Deliveries are
projected at send time against the owner's live visibility (withheld reads as
`skipped_visibility`, a permission outcome and not a failure), and
`assertDeliverableUrl` re-resolves DNS before every attempt because a
create-time-only SSRF check is decorative against rebinding.
`WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=true` lifts the https and private-address rules
for a local listener and belongs nowhere else.

### Raycast extension

`packages/raycast` is a Raycast extension with a deliberately small surface —
**five** commands: `menu-bar` (the macOS menu bar timer), `toggle-timer`
("Start / Stop Timer", the `no-view` hotkey), `timer` (the live view that ticks
by the second and is *both* start and stop), `entries` ("Show All Time"), and
`open-dashboard`. Everything else — reports, invoices, the calendar, catalog
curation — is web app work, reached in one keystroke rather than reimplemented
as a launcher command.

Composing an entry is one surface, not three. `components/entry-fields.tsx`
renders the five fields an entry is, and the three forms that write one — start
a timer, log past time (⌘⇧N), edit an entry — all call into it, which is what
keeps a project dropdown grouped by client from being grouped in only one of
them. Two of the three are composers and adopt a project's `billableDefault`;
the editor deliberately does not, because the flag on an existing entry is an
answer somebody already gave and a rate may already be snapshotted from it.

```bash
pnpm dev:raycast                      # builds @starter/core, then `ray develop`
pnpm build:raycast                    # `ray build -e dist`
```

It is a thin shell over `@starter/core` — `createApiClient` for the tRPC
HTTP endpoints, `session-auth.ts` for the device flow, the shared
`formatDuration` helpers for display. Domain logic belongs in `core` so
the browser extension and CLI inherit it; only Raycast UI belongs here.

- Auth: device flow, token in Raycast's encrypted `LocalStorage`, sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with `x-tracktime-client: tracktime-raycast`.
- `raycast-env.d.ts` is generated from `package.json` by `ray build` and is
  committed, so `pnpm typecheck` works without Raycast installed.
- Adding a command is the change to argue about, not adding a feature to one.
  Raycast has no runtime visibility control — `updateCommandMetadata` reaches
  only the *running* command's own subtitle, and background launches are limited
  to `no-view` and menu bar modes — so a "Stop Timer" command is listed whether
  or not anything is running. `timer` therefore adapts on open (Stop is the
  primary action while a timer runs, the start form when none does) and carries
  `keywords` so "start" and "stop" still find it. Continuous state belongs in
  the menu bar, which is the one surface that can hold it.
- `toggle-timer` is the exception, and the mode is the reason: only `no-view`
  and menu bar commands can be launched in the background, so it is the one
  surface a **global hotkey** can drive without opening a window. It stops what
  is running, or continues the newest entry in the same `RECENT_DAYS` window
  the other surfaces call recent, and reports either in a HUD. With nothing to
  resume it launches `timer` rather than starting a nameless entry the user
  then has to fix. Folding it into `timer` costs the hotkey, which is the whole
  point of it — a view command opens a window before it can do anything.
- Pairing has no command: `components/signed-out.tsx` pushes `components/
  sign-in.tsx` from the empty state every view shows while signed out, and
  ⌘⇧A in `timer` reopens it to see the account or sign out. Keep the push —
  `SignIn` opens the approval page in a browser on mount, which is helpful when
  asked for and rude when a list merely failed to load.
- **The description autocomplete is a pushed list, because Raycast has no combo
  box.** A `Form.TextField` cannot offer completions and a `Form.Dropdown`
  cannot accept a name that is not already in it, so ⌘⇧D pushes a searchable
  list of what this person has described work as before — `entries.descriptions`,
  the sibling of `entries.recent`. The two are keyed differently on purpose:
  a recent is keyed on the whole (description, project, task, billable)
  combination and answers "resume this job", a suggestion is keyed on the
  case-folded description alone and answers "you have called work this before".
  One list cannot do both without either repeating a name once per project it
  was ever filed under, or hiding the project it usually belongs to. Searched
  server-side rather than through Raycast's own filtering, because the rows on
  screen are a page out of six months — filtering the page would answer "no
  match" for a description that is certainly there. ⏎ takes the name alone;
  ⌘⇧⏎ takes the project, task, tags and billable flag with it, and is the
  secondary action because overwriting a project the user already picked is the
  destructive reading of "autofill the description".
- **`entries.create` is reachable from Raycast** (⌘⇧N, "Log Past Time"), so the
  meeting you forgot to time no longer needs the web app. Unlike the web
  dialog it does NOT roll a backwards end forward past midnight: that dialog's
  end field holds a time of day with its date coming from a separate control,
  where 23:30 → 00:30 is an hour of work; Raycast's two `DateTime` pickers each
  carry their own date, so a backwards end is a date the user really typed.
- Catalog forms live in `src/components/catalog/` and are pushed from the timer
  and edit forms (⌘⇧P/⌘⇧T/⌘⇧G), each calling back with the created row so the
  picker that opened it can select it. Creating a row mid-timer stays; browsing
  and curating one does not. The color palette
  is `CATALOG_COLORS` in `@starter/shared` — the same list the server assigns
  from and the web picker renders, so a color picked in one client is a color
  the next one can name.
- Raycast unloads a menu bar command once its first render settles, so a
  `setInterval` in it fires once and stops. An unfinished load is the one thing
  that keeps the process alive: the item passes `isLoading` while a timer runs,
  which is what lets the clock tick `m:ss` every second, and drops it when the
  timer stops so an idle item costs nothing. `interval` (1m) and the dropdown
  opening cover the unloaded case. Staying loaded means owning freshness:
  `entries.current` every 4s while ticking, because a stop made elsewhere would
  leave a clock counting up on an ended entry, and the whole snapshot every
  20s; mutations call `refreshMenuBar()` rather than waiting for either. Idle
  and running are separate preferences: `idleTitle` (bare mark by default,
  "Start timer", or the total) and `titleMode` (how much of a running timer).
  A total shown idle is `36m`, never `0:36` — the running clock owns the
  colon, and a total that borrowed it was read as a timer still going. The `Timer` view
  command is the surface that can push forms, which a menu bar item cannot.
  Both read `lib/timer-data.ts`, so the two surfaces cannot disagree about what
  is running.
- **`refreshMenuBar()` is a nudge, never the mechanism.** It is a background
  `launchCommand`, and Raycast may decline it — and a menu bar command that is
  still *loaded*, which is exactly what a running timer keeps it, is not
  remounted by one. On its own it left the item ticking an entry the user had
  just stopped from the `timer` command one process over. Four things carry the
  truth instead, in descending order of how quickly they notice and ascending
  order of how much they cost:
  - **The timer echo** (`timer-echo.ts` in `@starter/core`, `lib/storage.ts`
    here) — every timer mutation records `{ runningId, at }` in Raycast's
    `LocalStorage` the instant the server confirms it, written centrally in
    `api.ts` so a new command cannot forget. Any surface re-reads it once a
    second — a local read, no network — and `reconcileRunning` lets it outrank
    a snapshot *fetched before it*. This is the one that closes the gap
    between Raycast's separate command processes, and the only one that still
    works with the network down. It needs no TTL: the next successful fetch
    carries a later `fetchedAt`, so a stale record of a stop can never mask a
    timer started on another device.
  - **The sync socket** (`lib/sync.ts`) — held for as long as Raycast keeps a
    command alive, which is a view command while it is open and the menu bar
    item while it ticks. That is what makes a stop from the web app or another
    machine land at once rather than on a poll. It deliberately does NOT
    filter this install's own `originId`: every Raycast command shares one, so
    filtering would drop the event the menu bar needs most.
  - **`useWatchRunning`** — `entries.current` every 4s, but only while the
    socket is NOT connected. An open socket has already reported every stop,
    so polling underneath it asks a question that has been answered.
  - **`usePoll`** — the whole snapshot every 20s, which is also what picks up
    a renamed project or a new favorite.
- `entries.stop` is **idempotent when given an id**: an entry that is already
  stopped is returned rather than refused. Two devices racing to stop one timer
  is the normal case, and the loser asked for a state the world is already in.
  Without an id there is nothing to be idempotent about, so "nothing running"
  stays a 404 — which the clients read via `isAlreadyStopped` and report as
  success, because the user got what they wanted.
- Server origin and web origin come from extension preferences. Empty follows
  the build, the same convention as the browser extension's build targets:
  `ray build` → the deployed hosts, `ray develop` → `localhost:5159` /
  `localhost:3392`, the ports `pnpm run dev` pins. Neither preference
  carries a `default` in `package.json`, because a default there is stored as a
  real value and "untouched" would be indistinguishable from "typed the
  production URL". A worktree runs on random ports — set both by hand there.

### Deployment (two Coolify apps, two hosts)

Production is two apps on **two hosts of one zone**: `tracktime-client` on
`https://trackyourtime.dev` and `tracktime-server` on
`https://api.trackyourtime.dev`, from `docker-compose.client.yml` and
`docker-compose.server.yml`. The service name inside each file (`client` /
`server`) is load-bearing — Coolify keys `docker_compose_domains` by it, and a
mismatch yields 503 for the site with a 200 from Coolify's own API.
`docker-compose.yml` is the legacy single-app layout, kept for reference.

Two apps rather than one so a client deploy cannot restart the server and drop
every connected device's socket.

**Why the domain moved.** The previous layout put both apps on
`tracktime.trebeljahr.com` and split them by path (`/api` to the server),
because `api.tracktime.trebeljahr.com` could not get a certificate: Cloudflare
Universal SSL for that zone covers `trebeljahr.com` and `*.trebeljahr.com` —
**one** label — and that host is two. That constraint is real and still applies
to anything under `trebeljahr.com`.

The path split then failed for a second, independent reason: this Coolify
instance proxies with **caddy-docker-proxy**, not Traefik. Coolify writes
`traefik.*` labels onto every app and they are inert here; what routes is
`caddy_0=https://<host>` plus `caddy_0.handle_path`. Both apps wrote the same
`caddy_0` site for the same host, caddy-docker-proxy merged them, and the
client's `/*` won — so `https://tracktime.trebeljahr.com/api/health` was
answered by the client's 404 page. And `handle_path` **strips** its prefix, so
even ordered correctly the server (which mounts its routes AT `/api`) would
have received `/health`.

A fresh apex zone fixes both at once. `api.trackyourtime.dev` is one label
under `trackyourtime.dev`, so the wildcard covers it, and each app gets
`handle_path=/*` on a host of its own — no label collision, no prefix strip.

**Consequence: the API is a separate origin from the web app again.** CORS and
cookie handling are load-bearing, not decorative. `FRONTEND_URL` and
`TRUSTED_ORIGINS` on the server are what let the browser client and the
extension sign in at all; do not "simplify" them away.

The server still mounts everything it owns at `/api`, the socket included:
`resolveSyncUrl` derives `wss://api.trackyourtime.dev/api/ws`.
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is an **origin** with no path — the clients append
`/api/trpc`, `/api/auth` and `/api/ws` themselves — so real requests carry a
doubled-looking `api.trackyourtime.dev/api/...`. That is the mount, not a
mistake in the value. Stripping the mount would touch server, core, extension
and Raycast; it buys cosmetics only.

Four places must agree on the API origin: the server's `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
(set in Coolify's env fields — `packages/server/.env.production` is NOT tracked
in this repo, a global gitignore rule excludes it), the client image's
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` build arg in `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml`
(Next inlines it at image build time, so a wrong value builds green and points
at a dead API), `packages/extension/manifest.config.ts`, and
`packages/raycast/src/lib/preferences.ts`. See `docs/deploy.md`.

The client image serves the static export: `output: "export"` leaves no
`.next/standalone`, so the image is `out/` plus `packages/client/serve.mjs`.
The E2E suite runs that same file, so the deployed and tested servers cannot
drift apart.

### Browser extension

Five things the 380px popup does that are easy to break:

- **Descriptions autocomplete from `entries.descriptions`, searched
  server-side.** The rows are a page out of six months, so filtering a cached
  list locally answers "no match" for a description that is certainly there.
  The query rides on `descriptions:search`, which is answered with a whole
  snapshot like every other message and carries `descriptionsFor` beside the
  rows — typing outruns the round trip, and without the query the list would
  spend most of its life describing a prefix already moved past. It fails
  silently by design: a typeahead that raises the error banner because the
  network blinked is worse than one that offers nothing.
- **Tab completes, Enter does not.** Nothing is highlighted until a deliberate
  arrow press, so Enter still belongs to the surrounding form and starts the
  timer. A row's `＋` (or ⌘⏎) takes the project, task, tags and billable flag
  the newest entry with that name carried; the plain row takes the name alone,
  because overwriting a project the user already picked is the destructive
  reading of "autofill the description".
- **One `DescriptionField` for all three surfaces**, and one `ProjectPicker`.
  Commit-on-blur, Escape-reverts-without-the-blur-saving-it and the
  name-then-file-under-a-client panel are each fiddly enough that a second copy
  drifts. `DescriptionField` is controlled: each caller already owns when its
  text may be replaced, and a second copy of that rule could disagree.
- **Creating a catalog row selects it** (`useSelectWhenCreated`). The worker
  answers a create with a snapshot rather than the row, so there is no id at
  the call site and reading the list straight after the await races the
  render — waiting for the row to appear in props is the version that cannot.
  Before this, creating a tag mid-timer added it to the list and not to the
  entry.
- **The theme is a synced user preference**, applied from `<html data-theme>`
  before React's first render out of a `localStorage` copy. The popup is
  rebuilt on every open, so learning the theme from the worker's answer would
  flash the wrong one several times a day. The media query is guarded on the
  attribute being absent, so it cannot fight an explicit choice.

### Browser extension build modes

`packages/extension` bakes its API URL in at build time, so a build is a
target. Both are declared in `packages/extension/manifest.config.ts` — not in
`.env.*`, which is gitignored and would yield a URL-less bundle silently.

```bash
pnpm run build:extension        # dist/      -> http://localhost:5159
pnpm run build:extension:prod   # dist-prod/ -> https://api.trackyourtime.dev
pnpm run extension:id [dev|prod]  # the chrome-extension:// origin to trust
```

Each target carries its own name and `host_permissions`, so both can be
installed at once and a production build cannot be pointed at localhost. As
unpacked extensions the two have different ids, and **each id's origin must be
in that server's `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`**. The dev id is derived and trusted by
`pnpm run dev` (`scripts/lib/extension-id.mjs`, shared with `extension:id` so
the two can never disagree). The production id has to be pinned with
`EXTENSION_KEY` and added to the server app's `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in Coolify by
hand — deliberately: a production trust list that a script can extend is a
trust list nobody reviews.

### Static export caveats

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is baked at build time — desktop/mobile binaries
  are locked to whichever API URL they were built against. Rebuild to
  retarget.
- No `rewrites()`, no `middleware.ts`, no server components with runtime
  data. Dynamic routes need `generateStaticParams`.
- Next `<Image>` uses the default loader only because `images.unoptimized`
  is set in `next.config.ts`.

## Environment & Secrets (dotenvx)

The server reads env through **[dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com)** — a drop-in
`dotenv` replacement that also decrypts values marked `encrypted:...`.
`packages/server/src/config/env.ts` loads `.env.production` when
`NODE_ENV=production` and `.env.development` otherwise, **if the file exists**.

```
packages/server/
  .env.example        plaintext, committed (reference, no real secrets)
  .env.development    plaintext, local-dev defaults (localhost). NOT in the
                      repo and not committable on a machine whose global
                      gitignore lists `.env.development` — copy it from
                      .env.example. Anything a fresh checkout must have
                      belongs in .env.example or in scripts/dev.mjs.
  .env.production     NOT tracked in this repo — a global gitignore rule
                      (~/.config/git/ignore) excludes .env.production, and
                      there is no such file on disk. Purely a local
                      convenience if you make one.
  .env.keys           DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION, gitignored.
```

**Production env lives in Coolify's env fields, not in a file.** This is the
part that catches people out, because the starter this repo grew from shipped
a committed encrypted `.env.production` and dotenvx exists to decrypt exactly
that. Here there is nothing to decrypt: the file is untracked, and
`packages/server/Dockerfile`'s runtime stage copies only `dist`,
`package.json` and `node_modules`, so even an untracked local copy never
reaches the image. `DOTENV_PRIVATE_KEY_PRODUCTION` on its own therefore does
nothing in production. The compose files take every value as a `${VAR}`
substitution and Coolify fills them — that is the whole mechanism. See
`docs/deploy.md`.

Concretely: changing `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL` or `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`
means editing the **server app's env fields in Coolify** and redeploying. A
`dotenvx set ... -f .env.production` writes into a file production never
reads, deploys green, and leaves the server holding the old values with
nothing in the diff to point at.

### Running locally against production-shaped values

If you keep a local `packages/server/.env.production`, `.env.keys` is read
automatically — no extra step:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production pnpm --filter @starter/server start
```

That is the only thing that file is for. It is yours, it is not shared, and
nothing deploys from it.

### Encrypting a value in a local file

```bash
pnpm --filter @starter/server exec dotenvx set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY sk_live_... -f .env.production
pnpm --filter @starter/server exec dotenvx rotate -f .env.production
```

Both act on the local untracked file only. Keep `.env.keys` out of commits —
`.gitignore` enforces this.

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode everywhere. No `any` — use `unknown` and narrow.
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Named exports only (no default exports except Next.js pages which require them).
- Explicit return types on all public/exported functions.
- Use `@starter/shared` for types shared between client and server.
- Use `@/` path alias for client-side imports within the client package.

## File Organization

```
packages/server/src/
  config/       — environment variables, app config
  db/           — database connections (mongoose, redis)
  models/       — Mongoose schemas and models
  auth/         — better-auth instance and config
  trpc/         — tRPC router, context, procedures
    routers/    — individual tRPC routers (one per domain)
  ws/           — WebSocket handler, room manager, auth
  services/     — external service integrations (Stripe, email, S3)
  middleware/   — Express middleware (error handler, etc.)
  tests/        — server unit tests

packages/client/src/
  app/          — Next.js App Router pages
  lib/          — tRPC client, auth client, utilities
  providers/    — React context providers
  hooks/        — custom React hooks
  components/   — React components
    ui/         — shadcn/ui components
  styles/       — global CSS

packages/shared/src/
  protocol.ts   — WebSocket message types (discriminated unions)
  types.ts      — shared domain types
  schemas.ts    — Zod validation schemas
```

## Critical Middleware Ordering (Express)

The order in `app.ts` is load-bearing. Do not rearrange:

1. `better-auth` handler at `/api/auth/*` — BEFORE express.json (it handles its own body parsing)
2. Stripe webhook at `/api/stripe/webhook` with `express.raw()` — needs raw body for signature verification
3. `express.json()` + `express.urlencoded()` — JSON parsing for everything else
4. `helmet()` — security headers
5. `cors()` — CORS with credentials
6. `morgan()` — HTTP logging
7. tRPC middleware at `/api/trpc`
8. Health endpoint at `/api/health`
9. Error handlers (404 + 500) — must be last

## Environment Variables

- Always add new env vars to `.env.example` with a comment explaining the value
- Add sensible dev defaults to `.env.development` AND document them in
  `.env.example` — `.env.development` is a local file, not a committed one,
  so a value only there does not reach CI or another checkout. A value the
  dev stack must have is better set in `scripts/dev.mjs`, which passes it on
  the server's command line (and therefore wins over dotenvx, which does not
  overwrite an already-set key)
- Never commit `.env` or `.env.local` (these are gitignored)
- Server env vars: plain `process.env.X` via `config/env.ts`
- Client env vars: must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be available in the browser

## Testing Conventions

- **Server unit tests:** `node:test` module + `assert/strict`. Files in `packages/server/src/tests/*.test.ts`.
- **Client unit tests:** Vitest + @testing-library/react. Files colocated as `*.test.tsx`.
- **E2E tests:** Playwright. Files in `e2e/*.spec.ts`. Helpers in `e2e/helpers.ts`.
- Use `data-testid` attributes for E2E selectors, not CSS classes or text content.

## Commit Messages

Use conventional style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`.
Keep the first line under 72 characters. Add a blank line before any body text.

## Branch Naming

`feat/description`, `fix/description`, `refactor/description`.
