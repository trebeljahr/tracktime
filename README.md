# tracktime

A self-hostable time tracker: clients, projects, tasks, tags, billable rates, reports and invoices, with a web app, a browser extension and a Raycast extension sharing one backend.

Hosted instance: <https://tracktime.trebeljahr.com>. The API is served on `/api` of that same domain, not on a host of its own — [`docs/deploy.md`](docs/deploy.md) explains why.

> The build badge is pinned to `main` and reports the real state of the pipeline. It is not green — see [Not there yet](#not-there-yet).

## What it is

Time tracking for freelance and consulting work: start a timer, tag it with a client, project and task, and get the hours back as a report, a CSV, a PDF or an invoice. Rates are per project, snapshotted onto each entry when it is written, so changing a project's rate never rewrites what you already billed.

It is a pnpm monorepo — one Express + tRPC API, one Next.js web client, and shared packages the other clients reuse. Two Docker images and a MongoDB is the whole production footprint; Redis is optional. There is no SaaS tier gate and no telemetry you have not configured yourself.

Everything is scoped to a workspace, but today that is effectively one workspace per person — see [Not there yet](#not-there-yet) before assuming team features.

## Features

### Tracking

- **Timer with start / stop / continue / discard**, plus manual entry creation and editing. Entries carry a description, project, task, tags, a billable flag, a snapshotted hourly rate and currency, a source (web/desktop/mobile/extension/api/import) and the time zone they were recorded in.
- **Favorites and quick-start recents.** Favorites are reorderable one-tap job templates; quick-start collapses your recent entries into distinct combinations. Quick starts deliberately open untagged, so the same job tagged differently one day does not fragment the list.
- **Idle detection**, configurable per user (threshold, behaviour, whether a screen lock counts immediately), with a per-project behaviour override on the project itself.
- **Runaway-timer guard.** A maximum entry duration, evaluated lazily whenever something resolves what is running — asking what is current, starting another timer, joining the sync room. There is no cron: nothing pushes you a notification on Saturday about Friday's forgotten timer, it is caught the next time you look.

### Catalog

- **Clients → Projects → Tasks**, plus **Tags** as an orthogonal dimension (many per entry, across projects).
- Full CRUD. Clients, projects and tasks have an archive toggle and a delete that always deletes — never the tracked time, though: entries and favorites are detached and survive as project-less rows. Tags follow a different rule: a tag that still labels tracked time is archived instead of deleted, and only an unreferenced tag is removed outright (with a `$pull` sweep afterwards for anything written during the check).
- Projects carry colour, client, billable default, hourly rate, estimated hours, a budget amount and currency, and an idle-behaviour override.

### Views

- **Track** — the timer plus the day's entries.
- **Weekly timesheet grid** — rows of project + task, columns of weekday, editable cells. The edit rules are explicit and unit-tested: the running entry's cell is never writable, an empty cell creates exactly one entry, a single same-day entry has its end moved (typing 0 deletes it), and a midnight-crossing or multi-entry cell is refused read-only with a breakdown and a link through rather than guessing.
- **Calendar** — a time grid positioned by clock time, with drag editing, zoom, clustering for dense bursts of short entries, and an undo stack.

### Reports and money

- **Three reports**: summary (totals, grouped breakdown by project/client/task/tag, zero-filled daily series), detailed (paginated entry log whose totals span the whole range), and weekly (7-day grid).
- **CSV and PDF export** for all three, paginating the full range so an export is never a page of what you were looking at.
- **Invoices** built from un-invoiced billable time. Preview rolls up line items without writing; creating an invoice re-gathers server-side rather than trusting the client's line items, assigns a per-year sequential number, and stamps the invoice onto every entry it billed. Draft/sent/paid status, PDF export, and a guard that refuses edits to entries already on an invoice.
- **Project budgets and estimates** — a lifetime roll-up of hours and earnings against estimated hours and budget, computed from each entry's own snapshotted rate.

> Reporting grouped by tag gives each of an entry's tags that entry's **full** duration, so tag rows sum to more than the range total on purpose. The alternative — splitting a duration across tags — would invent time nobody spent. The screen says so where it happens; the report's own totals stay single-counted.

### Data in and out

- **Import from a delimited file.** Headers are matched to roles by an alias table and the values decide the granularity, so it is column shapes rather than vendor-specific formats. Day/month order is decided per file and stated on screen when nothing in the data settles it.
- **Preview then commit.** The commit re-parses the same input rather than trusting the preview it handed back, so a tampered preview cannot write something you never approved.
- **Every import is one undoable batch**, deleted by an indexed id — and refused if any of its entries have since landed on an invoice.
- **Workspace export**: JSON (lossless — colours, archived rows, project rates, catalog referenced by name so it restores into an empty or different workspace) and CSV (written in the exact column shape the importer reads back).

### Platform

- **Realtime multi-device sync** over WebSocket on the same Express process. The upgrade is authenticated and refused with a real 401/403; mutations carry a per-tab origin id echoed back, so a client ignores its own echo.
- **Offline queue** in the web app and browser extension: entry mutations made offline are queued and replayed on reconnect, with optimistic temporary ids until the server answers.
- **Sign-in for clients without a cookie jar** without minting API tokens. Every client signs in normally and sends the resulting session token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; clients that cannot show a form (Raycast, a CLI) use the RFC 8628 device flow, approved in an already signed-in browser. Sessions are named by their client under Settings → Devices, where any of them can be revoked — killing HTTP and WebSocket at once.
- **Split settings**: money and calendar conventions per workspace (default rate, currency, week start), rendering per user (12h/24h, h:m:s vs decimal, idle, limits).
- Optional Google sign-in, optional Sentry/GlitchTip error reporting, optional Listmonk + SES newsletter double-opt-in.

## Clients

| Client | State |
| --- | --- |
| **Web app** (Next.js static export) | Shipped, and the reference implementation. 14 signed-in routes: track, timesheet, calendar, three reports, clients, projects, tasks, tags, invoices, settings, profile, device. |
| **Browser extension** (Chrome MV3) | Working and genuinely useful — popup only, no content scripts. Timer, badge, catalog, favorites, idle and the offline queue. Version 0.1.0, not published to any store; you load it unpacked. |
| **Raycast extension** (macOS) | Working and broad — 4 commands (menu bar timer, a live one-second timer view, an entries browser and an open-dashboard action), with full catalog CRUD reached through pushed forms rather than commands of its own. Not published to the Raycast store, and it has **no offline queue**: a mutation made without connectivity is lost, unlike the same action from the web app or extension. |
| **Desktop** (Electron) | Real but thin. Window lifecycle, persisted fullscreen preference, external-link handling and `powerMonitor`-backed idle reporting over IPC. No tray icon, no global shortcuts, no auto-update, no signing setup. Never built or distributed. |
| **Desktop** (Tauri) | Scaffolding only — 24 lines of Rust with an empty setup and a Steamworks block inherited from the starter this repo was generated from. Do not count it as a desktop app. |
| **Mobile** (Capacitor) | Config and a small JS bridge only. No `ios/` or `android/` directory exists, the bundle id is still `com.example.tracktime`, and nothing has been run on a device — despite the `dev:ios` / `dev:android` / `build:mobile` scripts existing in `package.json`. |
| **CLI** | Does not exist. `tracktime-cli` appears only as an allowlisted device-flow client id. |

## Not there yet

Stated plainly, because the code has more scaffolding than product in these areas:

- **Teams, invitations and workspace switching.** The substrate is real — every user gets a personal workspace, there is a member model with roles and visibility flags, and one middleware scopes every query — and better-auth's `organization` plugin is mounted, so its create-organization, invite-member, list-members and set-role endpoints are callable under `/api/auth/*`. What is missing is everything above them: **no tRPC router, no invite UI, no member list, no role editing and no workspace switcher**. The invitation email links to `/invite/<id>`, and that page does not exist, so an invitation sent today lands on a 404. The realtime layer is not ready either: every member currently receives the identical sync payload, which is only correct while a workspace has one member. Treat this as a single-user app.
- **A public REST API.** The server mounts exactly four things: better-auth, tRPC, two newsletter routes and a health check. There is no versioned REST surface, no OpenAPI document, no API-key model and no rate limiting. tRPC is reachable with a bearer session token, but it is an internal contract typed against this repo, not a documented public API. (The `api` value in the `EntrySource` enum is reserved for third-party callers and nothing produces it today.)
- **Timesheet approvals.** Nothing. No submitted/approved state, no approver role, no lock-after-approval, no notifications. The timesheet is an editing grid, not a submittable document. Invoice status is invoice lifecycle, not time approval.
- **Time off, PTO, holidays, absence.** No model, no screen, no shared type. There is no non-working-day concept, so nothing computes capacity or utilization.
- **Notifications of any kind.** No web push, no email digests, no scheduler, no job runner. The runaway guard is lazy on purpose and says so in its own source.
- **SaaS subscription billing.** There is no Stripe service in the server at all — only a `billing.status` query that reports which `STRIPE_*` env vars are missing so the UI can show a developer notice. (Watch the word: "Billing" in the settings screen means *your clients' billable rates*, not a subscription.)
- **Avatar upload / object storage.** An S3 service module exists and nothing imports it. `avatarUrl` is a field with no upload path behind it.
- **Search, a command palette, and third-party integrations.** No global search, no palette, no calendar sync, no issue-tracker or commit import. Import is file-based only.
- **Email verification is off.** Password reset, verification and invitation mail goes out over SMTP once `SMTP_HOST` is set, and falls back to logging the URL to the server console when no transport is configured at all — which is the default local setup. `requireEmailVerification` is still `false`.
- **CI has never gone green.** The build-and-deploy workflow has two runs in its history — one failed at the build/test job, the other at E2E — so the Docker image builds and the deploy path have never actually executed. The self-host images are published by a separate tag-triggered workflow ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)), which has not run either — no `v*` tag has been cut yet, so `docker compose` builds them locally until one is.

## Self-hosting

One VPS, one domain, one command. [`docker-compose.selfhost.yml`](docker-compose.selfhost.yml) brings up Caddy, the API, the static web app, Mongo and Redis, with Caddy terminating TLS and routing `/api` and `/ws` to the server and everything else to the client.

```bash
cp .env.selfhost.example .env
```

Set `APP_DOMAIN` and `APP_URL` to your domain, generate `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, then:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.selfhost.yml up -d
```

[`docs/self-hosting.md`](docs/self-hosting.md) is the full manual: prerequisites, first run, SMTP, backup and restore, upgrades, and troubleshooting.

### Which compose file is which

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docker-compose.selfhost.yml` | **Self-hosting.** Everything on one domain behind Caddy, with Mongo and Redis included. The one you want. |
| `docker-compose.dev.yml` | Local dev infra only: Mongo, Redis, SeaweedFS S3. No app containers. |
| `docker-compose.server.yml` | The maintainer's production API. One service, `server`. Expects an externally managed Mongo/Redis. |
| `docker-compose.client.yml` | The maintainer's production web app. One service, `client`. |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Legacy single-app layout. Its own header documents that nothing routes `/api` to the server under it. |

The service names `server` and `client` are load-bearing under Coolify — it keys routing by them. Do not rename them.

Under the self-host layout the client image is built with an **empty** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, so every call the browser makes is same-origin and the image works on anybody's domain. That is why it is published separately as `ghcr.io/trebeljahr/tracktime-client-selfhost` — the `:main` client image bakes in the maintainer's own API host.

### `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`

A single-domain self-host does not need this at all: the browser's origin *is* `FRONTEND_URL`. It matters when something other than that domain signs in.

better-auth validates the `Origin` header on sign-in whenever the request carries `Sec-Fetch-*` headers, which every real browser fetch does. A browser origin that is not `FRONTEND_URL` gets `403 INVALID_ORIGIN` **before the password is checked**. Add, comma-separated, whichever apply:

- `chrome-extension://<id>` — the browser extension (`pnpm run extension:id prod` prints it)
- `capacitor://localhost,https://localhost` — Capacitor
- `app://-` — Electron via a custom protocol (`file://` sends `Origin: null` and cannot be trusted with credentials)
- `tauri://localhost` and `http://tauri.localhost` — Tauri on macOS/Linux and Windows

Raycast and CLI clients need nothing here — their requests carry neither `Origin` nor `Sec-Fetch-*`. What guards them is the device flow plus the client-id allowlist in `packages/server/src/auth/client-label.ts`.

## Development

Requires Node 24 (`.nvmrc`), pnpm 11 via corepack, and Docker for the local infra.

```bash
corepack enable
nvm install && nvm use

git clone https://github.com/trebeljahr/tracktime.git && cd tracktime
pnpm install

# REQUIRED — .env.development is not tracked, so create it from the example
cp packages/server/.env.example packages/server/.env.development
# then set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET in it to any 32+ character string

pnpm run dev:infra     # Mongo 27017, Redis 6379, SeaweedFS S3 9000 (docker)
pnpm run dev           # client 3392, API 5159
```

Open <http://localhost:3392>.

`pnpm run dev` pins those ports on purpose: the browser extension, Raycast and any native build bake their API URL in and cannot follow a port that moves. Variants:

```bash
pnpm run dev:auto            # every port auto-picked — use this for a second instance
pnpm run dev:fixed           # the pinned ports, or exit
pnpm run dev:docs            # also runs the docs site on 4000
node scripts/dev.mjs --dry-run   # print the resolved ports, start nothing
```

**Inside a git worktree, `pnpm run dev` behaves like `dev:auto`** so parallel checkouts do not fight over the pinned ports — which also means the extension and Raycast will not find the server there unless you run `dev:fixed` or point them at the printed ports.

Other clients:

```bash
pnpm run dev:extension       # browser extension, dev target (localhost:5159)
pnpm run build:extension     # dist/       -> http://localhost:5159
pnpm run build:extension:prod # dist-prod/ -> https://tracktime.trebeljahr.com
pnpm run extension:id [dev|prod]  # the chrome-extension:// origin to trust

pnpm run dev:raycast         # ray develop
pnpm run dev:desktop         # Next dev + an Electron window
```

`pnpm run seed:assets`, `assets:push` and `assets:pull` shell out to a private CLI that is not installable from this repo. Nothing about running or testing the app depends on them — skip them.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm run test:unit      # 21 server suites (node:test) — pure logic, no services needed
pnpm run test:client    # 27 Vitest suites in the client — jsdom, no services needed
pnpm run test:e2e       # 10 Playwright specs — REQUIRES DOCKER
pnpm test               # all three in sequence

pnpm run typecheck      # builds shared + core, then tsc --noEmit everywhere else
pnpm run build          # shared -> core -> server -> client
```

The E2E suite starts its own Mongo, Redis and S3 containers on separate ports and runs against the **static export**, not the dev server, so the first run includes a full client build. It needs Docker and a one-off `npx playwright install chromium`. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#tests-and-checks) has the details, including the port and database variables you must set if another checkout is running the suite at the same time.
