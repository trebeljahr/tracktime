# One-command Android dev loop with live reload.
#
# What this does:
#   1. Source scripts/android-env.sh so JAVA_HOME / ANDROID_HOME are set.
#   2. Boot the emulator if nothing is attached (or use attached device).
#   3. Start Next.js dev server on 0.0.0.0 so the emulator can reach it.
#   4. cap sync with CAP_DEV_URL — capacitor.config.ts injects server.url
#      when that env var is set, making the WebView load from the Next
#      dev server instead of bundled assets.
#   5. cap run android — installs the APK and launches.
#
# Edits to packages/client/src hot-reload on the device in ~500ms.
#
# This script starts the Next dev server and points the WebView at it. It does
# NOT start the API — run that separately, and tell this script where it is:
#
#   API_PORT=51590 PORT=33920 pnpm run dev     # in another terminal
#   API_PORT=51590 pnpm dev:android
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is read by the Next dev server at start and baked into
# the fallback bundle, so a wrong API_PORT here is a phone that loads and then
# fails every request. It is exported explicitly rather than left to whatever
# happens to be in the environment, and it is pointed at the SAME host the
# WebView loads from: from inside the emulator "localhost" is the emulator and
# not the Mac, so an API on the Mac is 10.0.2.2 (the emulator's NAT alias for
# the host), and on a real device it is the Mac's LAN IP.
#
# Under live reload the document origin is http://$DEV_HOST:$NEXT_PORT, not
# https://localhost — so this exercises neither the app's real origin nor its
# place in the server's trust list. Verify auth changes against
# `pnpm build:mobile`, never against this.
#
# Env overrides:
#   AVD=<name>       which AVD to boot (default: Medium_Phone_API_35)
#   NEXT_PORT=<n>    Next.js dev port (default: 51740)
#   API_PORT=<n>     port the API is already listening on (default: 5159)
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL  full API origin override, wins over API_PORT
#   LAN_IP=<ip>      host the device should reach the Mac at (default:
#                    10.0.2.2, the emulator alias). Required for a real device.
#   CAP_DEV_URL=<url> full WebView dev URL override, e.g.
#                     https://<slug>.local.<your-domain>/
