/*
 * Rasterize every bitmap the app ships from the one brand mark.
 *
 * `mark-tile.svg` is the canonical mark. The bare timer arc draws a neutral
 * track ring meant for a page background, which disappears against browser
 * chrome, a macOS dock or a menu bar; the tile carries its own indigo ground
 * and reads the same everywhere. So every raster surface derives from the
 * tile, and this script is what keeps them derived instead of drifting into
 * hand-edited binaries nobody can regenerate. (They had: before this script
 * existed, every PNG below except the extension's was a flat #6366F1 square
 * with no mark in it at all — the starter placeholder, inherited by the
 * Electron, Tauri, Raycast and Capacitor builds in turn.)
 *
 * The generated files are committed, because the toolchains that consume them
 * cannot rasterize an SVG themselves: Chrome's `icons` manifest key takes PNG
 * only, `tauri icon` and `capacitor-assets` take a PNG source, and Raycast
 * reads PNG from `assets/`.
 *
 * Run after any change to the mark:  pnpm run icons:brand
 * Then re-run the downstream generators that fan these out further:
 *   pnpm run icons:desktop   build/icon.png  -> icns + ico
 *   pnpm run icons:tauri     build/icon.png  -> src-tauri/icons/*
 *   pnpm run mobile:assets   resources/*.png -> ios/ + android/
 *
 * resources/ holds five inputs, all generated here: icon.png (the launcher
 * icon's source), splash.png / splash-dark.png, and the icon-foreground.png /
 * icon-background.png pair Android's adaptive icon needs.
