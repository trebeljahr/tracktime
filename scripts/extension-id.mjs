/**
 * Print the Chrome extension id, and the origin the server has to trust.
 *
 * The origin matters because better-auth force-validates it on sign-in. A real
 * browser sends `Sec-Fetch-Site`/`Sec-Fetch-Mode`, which makes better-auth
 * check the `Origin` header against `trustedOrigins` even with no cookie on
 * the request; an untrusted extension origin gets a flat
 * `403 {"code":"INVALID_ORIGIN"}` before the password is ever looked at.
 *
 * Two ways an id comes about, and this reports whichever applies:
 *
 *  - A `key` pinned in the manifest fixes the id wherever it is loaded from.
 *    That is the only way to know a production id before uploading anything.
 *  - Otherwise an unpacked extension's id is derived from the absolute path it
 *    was loaded from — stable for a directory, different for every checkout.
 *
 *   node scripts/extension-id.mjs [dev|prod|<path-to-unpacked-dir>]
