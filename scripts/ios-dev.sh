# One-command iOS Simulator dev loop with live reload.
#
# Mirror of scripts/android-dev.sh for iOS Simulator.
#
# This script starts the Next dev server and points the WebView at it. It does
# NOT start the API — run that separately, and tell this script where it is:
#
#   API_PORT=51590 PORT=33920 pnpm run dev     # in another terminal
#   API_PORT=51590 pnpm dev:ios
#
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is read by the Next dev server at start and baked into
# the fallback bundle, so a wrong API_PORT here is a phone that loads and then
# fails every request — which is why it is exported explicitly rather than left
# to whatever happens to be in the environment.
#
# Under live reload the document origin is http://localhost:$NEXT_PORT, which is
# the same *site* as a localhost API (port is not part of a site). Cookie auth
# therefore appears to work here and fails from capacitor://localhost in a real
# bundle. Verify auth changes against `pnpm build:mobile`, never against this.
#
# Env overrides:
#   SIM=<device name>   simulator to use (default: iPhone 17)
#   NEXT_PORT=<n>       Next.js dev port (default: 51730)
#   API_PORT=<n>        port the API is already listening on (default: 5159)
#   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL full API origin override, wins over API_PORT
#   LAN_IP=<ip>         override host (default: localhost — simulators
#                       share the Mac's network namespace)
#   CAP_DEV_URL=<url>   full WebView dev URL override, e.g.
#                       https://<slug>.local.<your-domain>/
