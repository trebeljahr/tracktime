/*
 * Capacitor (iOS + Android) configuration.
 *
 * The mobile build is produced by `pnpm build:mobile` (scripts/build-mobile.mjs),
 * which runs `next build` against packages/client with NEXT_DIST_DIR=out-mobile
 * and then `cap sync`. Capacitor copies the exported
 * packages/client/out-mobile/ into ios/App/App/public and
 * android/app/src/main/assets/public.
 *
 * webDir is out-mobile rather than the usual out/ on purpose: the web build and
 * the Playwright E2E build both write packages/client/out (the E2E one with a
 * throwaway 127.0.0.1 API port baked in), and `cap run` syncs implicitly — so a
 * shared directory means a test run can silently ship its own bundle into the
 * app. Nothing but scripts/build-mobile.mjs writes out-mobile.
 *
 * appId and appName here are NOT applied to the native projects: `cap add` is a
 * bare template extraction (@capacitor/cli/dist/ios/add.js), so
 * PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER, CFBundleDisplayName, namespace and applicationId
 * are hand-edited in ios/ and android/ and must be kept in step with these by
 * hand.
 *
 * Live reload in dev: scripts/android-dev.sh / scripts/ios-dev.sh
 * set CAP_DEV_URL so the WebView loads from the Next dev server
 * on localhost, your LAN, or the hatchkit Tailscale dev URL instead
 * of the bundled export.

   * rubber-band gutters for every dark-mode user. There is only one value and

   * `0 0% 3.9%`): light-mode users get one dark frame, which reads as the app
