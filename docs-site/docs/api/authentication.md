description: Minting an API token, the scope table, how a token's visibility is resolved, and what revoking one does.

# Authentication

Every route but `/openapi.json` requires an API token:

```
Authorization: Bearer tt_Ab3xY9Zq_kR2…
```

There is nothing else to configure. No OAuth dance, no signing of requests, no
separate API key and secret.

## Minting a token

**Settings → Integrations → New token.** Give it a name, tick the scopes it needs, and
optionally set an expiry date.

The plaintext is shown **once**, at creation, and is never recoverable afterwards —
only a SHA-256 hash of it is stored. If you lose it, revoke that token and mint
another. What the settings screen shows from then on is the token's non-secret
prefix (`tt_Ab3xY9Zq…`), which is enough to tell two tokens apart in a list and
useless as a credential.

A token looks like `tt_<prefix>_<secret>`: an 8-character prefix used to look the row
up, and a 43-character secret carrying 256 bits from the system CSPRNG. Send the whole
string; the prefix alone authenticates nothing, because the stored hash covers the
entire token.

## Scopes

Scopes are deny-by-default. A token grants exactly the scopes ticked when it was
minted, and a route refuses with `403 insufficient-scope` unless its scope is among
them. A token with no scopes at all is legal and can do nothing — which is the correct
behaviour for an empty list, not an edge case to guess around.

| Scope | Grants |
| --- | --- |
| `entries:read` | List, fetch and page time entries; read the running timer. |
| `entries:write` | Create, edit and delete entries; start and stop timers. |
| `catalog:read` | List and fetch clients, projects, tasks and tags. |
| `catalog:write` | Create, edit, archive and delete catalog rows. |
| `reports:read` | Summary, detailed and weekly reports. |

Write does **not** imply read. A route that needs `entries:read` needs it even if the
token holds `entries:write` — so a token that only pushes entries in cannot be turned
around and used to read the workspace's history.

[The reference](./reference.md) names the required scope for every route, and so does
the OpenAPI document, as `x-required-scope` on each operation.

## What a token can see

A workspace member has two visibility flags, both off by default:

- **`canViewOthersTime`** — see other members' entries, not only your own.
- **`canViewOthersMoney`** — see hourly rates and the amounts derived from them.

A token carries its creating member's flags, resolved on **every request** and
intersected with the flags that member had when the token was minted. Two rules fall
out of that, and both matter:

- **Revoking a permission narrows the token immediately.** A member demoted today
  stops seeing colleagues' money through a token minted last year, on the next
  request.
- **Granting a permission does not widen it.** A token minted under a narrower grant
  keeps that ceiling; to use a newly granted permission, mint a new token. Nobody
  should discover that a year-old credential silently gained reach.

Removing the member from the workspace kills their tokens outright: `401`, not `403`.
There is no membership left to derive a scope from.

`GET /me` reports the *effective* flags, so a client can decide whether to render a
money column at all rather than discovering the answer from a 403 three screens later.

### How money is withheld

Where a response can honestly be narrowed, it is:

- `GET /entries` and `GET /entries/:id` set `hourlyRate: null` on any row whose author
  is not you when `canViewOthersMoney` is off. When the rate is withheld, `amount` is
  `0` — **do not read that as "earned nothing"**. `hourlyRate === null` means
  *withheld*; branch on it before showing any figure.
- `GET /projects` and `GET /projects/:id` set `progress` to `null`. Budget progress
  spans every member's entries, so `spentAmount` is aggregate colleague earnings.

Where it cannot, the request is refused: `GET /reports/*` answers
`403 money-visibility-required` when a token may see colleagues' *time* but not their
*money*. A report is totals; there is no honest stripped version of a total. Zeroing
it produces a page of numbers a spreadsheet will sum, and omitting it produces a
report whose own figures do not reconcile.

Both other combinations are served normally. With `canViewOthersTime` off the rows are
your own, so every amount in the report is your own earnings; with both flags on there
is nothing to withhold.

## Revoking

**Settings → Integrations** lists every token with its prefix, scopes, expiry and last
use. Revoking one takes effect on the next request — there is no cache to wait out.
An expired token is refused the same way.

Every failure — unknown, malformed, revoked, expired, or belonging to a removed
member — answers the same `401 invalid-token` body. Telling those apart would confirm
which prefixes exist.

`lastUsedAt` is written at most once a minute per token, so a token used ten times a
second does not turn its own row into the hottest document in the database. Treat it
as "was this used today", not as an audit log.

## Not the same as a client session

The browser extension, Raycast and the desktop and mobile builds do not use API
tokens. They sign in as you and keep a better-auth **session** token, which the server
accepts on the tRPC surface. Those appear under **Settings → Devices** and are revoked
there.

API tokens are the credential for *your own* integrations: scripts, CI jobs,
third-party tools. They are scoped, a session is not; a session follows a person's
full permissions, a token can only ever hold a subset.
