// Relative asset paths are required only by the shells that load the exported
// client off a file:// document, where there is no server and no root to be
// absolute from: Electron (`build:desktop`, `electron:build`,
// `electron:preview`) and Tauri (`build:tauri`). Those four — and only those
// four — set RELATIVE_ASSET_PREFIX=1. The flag is named for what it does
// rather than for one of its consumers, because `build:tauri` setting a
// variable called ELECTRON_BUILD reads like a copy-paste slip and invites a
// deletion that silently blanks the Tauri window.
//
// Capacitor is deliberately NOT in that list. CapacitorRouter.route(for:)
// (node_modules/@capacitor/ios/Capacitor/Capacitor/Router.swift) resolves every
// asset from the bundle root: it returns `basePath + "/index.html"` when the
// path has no extension and `basePath + path` otherwise. So with
// `trailingSlash: true`, a chunk requested as "./_next/…" from a document at
// /track/ resolves to "/track/_next/…", which has an extension, and the router
// looks for a file that does not exist — a blank screen behind a splash
// `launchAutoHide: false` never hides. Root-absolute "/_next/…" is correct
// there, and is what the web build already uses.
//
// Relative paths are WRONG for the web build for the same reason: a page
// served at /track/ would resolve "./_next/..." to "/track/_next/..." and every
// asset 404s. So the prefix is opt-in and never applied to `next dev` or to a
// web production build.
