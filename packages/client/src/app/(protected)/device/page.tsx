 * The browser half of the device-authorization flow.
 *
 * Raycast, a CLI or a TV-style client shows a short code; the user types it
 * here — already signed in, in a real browser — and the waiting client
 * receives a session of its own. It sits inside `(protected)` so an anonymous
 * visitor is sent to sign in first, which is exactly the right order.
 *
 * The code may arrive prefilled via `?user_code=`, so `useSearchParams` needs
 * a Suspense boundary for the static export.
