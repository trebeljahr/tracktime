/**
 * Unit tests for `resolveSyncUrl` in @starter/core — the one rule the web app,
 * the browser extension and any future client all derive the sync socket's URL
 * from.
 *
 * Worth pinning because nothing else catches it. There is no E2E coverage of
 * the socket, and `connectSync` skips an unusable URL quietly rather than
 * throwing, so a wrong path here reaches production as "sync just doesn't
 * work" with every HTTP request still succeeding.
 *
 * The `/api` prefix in particular is load-bearing for the deployment: the
 * server mounts everything it owns at `/api`, so a socket outside it would
 * need its own proxy rule. See docs/deploy.md.
