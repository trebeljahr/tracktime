/**
 * The running timer, written somewhere it survives the app being killed.
 *
 * Without this, a cold launch with no network shows no timer at all — not a
 * stale one, not a spinner: `trpc.entries.current` has no persisted React
 * Query cache, so it never answers, and the store stays at its `null` initial
 * state. The user force-quits a running timer on the train, opens the app
 * again, and the app they are using to track time says nothing is running.
 *
 * So every server answer about the running entry is mirrored into Capacitor
 * Preferences, and the store is seeded from that mirror at boot, before the
 * query fires. `packages/core/src/timer-store.ts` derives elapsed seconds from
 * `entry.start` against the wall clock — it never accumulates — so a seeded
 * entry ticks correctly straight away no matter how long the app was dead.
 *
 * Two rules:
 *
 *  - **Native only.** On web a reload is online by definition and the query
 *    answers in milliseconds; seeding there would mean every reload flashes
 *    the previous timer before the server has a say.
 *  - **The seed is provisional.** It is what the server said last time, not
 *    what the server says now. `useRunningEntry` replaces it the moment the
 *    query actually succeeds — including with `null`, which is how a timer
 *    stopped from another device disappears — and only a real success is
 *    allowed to overwrite it.
