/**
 * better-auth validates its baseURL with `new URL()`, so a relative
 * "/api/auth" throws. With `output: "export"` every page is prerendered in
 * Node — where there is no origin and NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL may be unset — so
 * the URL has to be resolved defensively:
 *
 *  - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL when set (inlined at build time for the Docker
 *    image, the desktop bundle and the mobile bundle),
 *  - the live origin in the browser, which is what same-origin web
 *    deployments use,
 *  - a throwaway absolute URL during prerendering. No auth request is made
 *    while prerendering, and the client re-resolves against the real origin
 *    on hydration.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT throw when the URL is missing on native, tempting
 * as that is. This runs at module scope, `AuthProvider` imports it and the
 * root layout renders that — so a throw here aborts React before it mounts,
 * `MobileBridgeLoader` never calls `hideSplash()`, and a splash configured
 * with `launchAutoHide: false` stays up forever with no console to read. The
 * enforcement point is the build: `scripts/build-mobile.mjs` refuses to run
 * without `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and then greps the emitted chunks for the
 * literal, so a mis-targeted bundle cannot be produced in the first place.
