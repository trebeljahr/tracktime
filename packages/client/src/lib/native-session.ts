/**
 * The native shell's session credential.
 *
 * A `capacitor://localhost` document is cross-site to the API no matter what
 * SameSite says, and WKWebView's tracking prevention drops the cookie anyway.
 * So the native shells use the same path Raycast and the browser extension
 * use: sign in normally, keep the better-auth **session token**, and send it
 * as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (and as the `bearer.<token>` WebSocket
 * subprotocol). There is no second credential type and no server change —
 * `packages/core/src/session-auth.ts` documents the whole contract.
 *
 * Three things this module is careful about:
 *
 *  - **It is inert on web.** Every export short-circuits when `isNative()` is
 *    false, and nothing here imports a Capacitor package at module scope, so
 *    the web bundle never pulls one in.
 *
 *  - **The token lives in the Keychain**, via
 *    `@aparajita/capacitor-secure-storage` — not `@capacitor/preferences`,
 *    which is plain UserDefaults and readable from an unencrypted device
 *    backup. Preferences stays right for the offline queue: data, not a
 *    credential.
 *
 *  - **Keychain items outlive the app.** iOS does not clear an app's Keychain
 *    on delete, so a reinstall would silently resume the previous session —
 *    including a previous *user's* session on a handed-down device. Preferences
 *    *is* wiped on delete, so a marker written there tells a fresh install from
 *    a relaunch, and a fresh install starts signed out. See
 *    `enforceFreshInstall()`.
 *
 * Readiness is published as a store rather than gating the React tree: under
 * `output: "export"` every page is prerendered in Node, where `isNative()` is
 * false, so a component that renders `null` while hydrating would disagree
 * with the served HTML and force React to throw the whole subtree away. The
 * consumers — `ProtectedLayout`'s recheck and `useSync`'s socket — wait on
 * the flag instead. Same rule the tab bar follows.
