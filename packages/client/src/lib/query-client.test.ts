/**
 * Where `networkMode: "always"` may and may not appear.
 *
 * It was originally set as a global `defaultOptions.mutations`, justified
 * entirely by the two mutation families that queue offline work. That
 * justification does not reach the other forty-odd mutations in the app —
 * profile edits, catalog renames, invoice writes, the calendar's drag-to-move,
 * every one of them on the web as well as on the phone. React Query's default
 * *pauses* those while offline and replays them on reconnect with their
 * optimistic state intact; "always" replaced that with an immediate rejection,
 * a rollback and an error toast on any blip.
 *
 * So the option is now opt-in per mutation, and these specs pin both halves:
 * the client's own defaults leave mutations alone, and the option still does
 * the thing the queue depends on.
