 * One offline queue for the whole signed-in app.
 *
 * `useOfflineQueue()` used to be called from `TrackerBar`, which renders only
 * on `/track`. Everything that drains the queue — the socket reopening, the
 * network coming back — is wired up inside that hook, so a user who
 * reconnected while looking at Reports or Settings had nothing listening:
 * their queued entries sat there until they happened to navigate to the
 * tracker. That is a plain web bug, not a mobile one; it is simply guaranteed
 * on a phone, where the app is backgrounded and resumed on whatever screen it
 * was left on.
 *
 * Mounting it in `AppShell` fixes it for every route at once. The context
 * exists so `TrackerBar` and the resume handler read the same instance rather
 * than each starting their own flush loop.
