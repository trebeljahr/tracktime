/*
 * `KeyValueStorage` over `@capacitor/preferences`, for the data the native
 * shell cannot afford to lose.
 *
 * WKWebView classifies `localStorage` as *non-critical web data*: iOS evicts
 * it after low storage, and after roughly seven days of app inactivity. The
 * offline queue holds tracked time that has never reached a server, so an
 * eviction there is not a cache miss — it is a day of the user's work, gone,
 * with no error anywhere. `webStorage()` swallows every throw
 * (`packages/core/src/storage.ts`), so it would not even be loud about it.
 *
 * Preferences is `UserDefaults` / `SharedPreferences`: app-container data the
 * OS keeps until the app is deleted. It is deliberately NOT where the session
 * token lives — that is the Keychain, see `lib/native-session.ts`. Data here,
 * credentials there.
 *
 * The plugin is loaded lazily so the web bundle never pulls a Capacitor
 * package in, and the whole module is inert unless `isNative()`.
