/*
 * A LIFO registry of the overlays that are open right now — dialogs, the nav
 * drawer, anything that covers the screen and should absorb one press of
 * Android's hardware back button before the app navigates or exits.
 *
 * Why a registry and not the URL: a WebView reload always lands on `/`
 * (ios/App/App/Router.swift serves the root index.html for any extensionless
 * path), so a modal pushed into history would be restored over nothing. The
 * stack lives in memory for exactly as long as the overlays do.
 *
 * Why not `document.querySelectorAll('[role=dialog]')`: an overlay knows how
 * to close itself and the DOM does not. Radix dialogs, the drawer and any
 * future sheet each register their own dismiss.
 *
 * Inert on web by construction — nothing reads the stack except the back
 * button handler in components/app-shell.tsx, and `backButton` is an Android
 * event. Registration itself costs an array push.
