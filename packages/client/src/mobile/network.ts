/*
 * What "online" actually means, per platform.
 *
 * `navigator.onLine` is the browser's answer and it is a good one in a
 * browser. In WKWebView it is not: it routinely reports `true` on a dead
 * radio, and it does not fire `online`/`offline` when the phone enters or
 * leaves airplane mode. Two things downstream take that lie seriously:
 *
 *  - `isNetworkError()` short-circuits to `true` when `isOnline()` is false.
 *    A lying `true` therefore makes a genuine server rejection look like a
 *    transport failure — the mutation is queued forever instead of rolled
 *    back — and a lying `false` makes a real refusal look like a hiccup.
 *  - React Query's `onlineManager` decides whether to fetch at all. Fed the
 *    browser's answer, a backgrounded phone wakes up and fires a burst of
 *    doomed requests into a radio that is not there.
 *
 * So on native the truth comes from `@capacitor/network`, which reads the
 * OS reachability API. On web nothing changes: the same `navigator.onLine`
 * plus the same `online`/`offline` events, through one subscription surface
 * so callers do not care which platform they are on.
 *
 * The plugin is imported lazily; the web bundle never pulls it in.
