/**
 * What happens when the app comes back to the foreground, in the order it has
 * to happen in.
 *
 * 1. **Reconnect.** The server pings every 10s and drops the socket on the
 *    first missed pong, so the connection is dead server-side within ~20s of
 *    every backgrounding — but a frozen socket delivers no close event, so
 *    the client still believes it is open and never retries.
 * 2. **Tick.** Synchronous and instant, so the clock is right on the FIRST
 *    frame rather than up to a second later. Elapsed is derived from
 *    `entry.start`, so this is just "recompute now".
 * 3. **Flush, and only then invalidate.** This order is load-bearing and the
 *    obvious one is wrong. A timer started with no signal lives in the queue
 *    and in an optimistic `entries.current`; refetching first asks a server
 *    that has never heard of that start, gets `null`, and blanks the running
 *    clock — the timer visibly vanishes and comes back seconds later, on
 *    exactly the recovery path this exists to smooth. The flush already
 *    invalidates entries and reports when it applies anything, so when there
 *    is something queued the explicit invalidate is not merely reordered, it
 *    is not run at all.
