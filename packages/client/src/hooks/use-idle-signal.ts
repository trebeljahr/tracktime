 * A browser tab is a poor idle detector, on purpose.

 * for an hour produces exactly the same silence as somebody who went to lunch.
 * Treating that silence as idleness would pause timers for people who are
 * working, which is the single worst thing this feature could do. So the web
 * detector only accumulates idleness while its window is both visible *and*
 * focused — "tracktime is the window you are looking at, and you are not
 * touching it" — and reports `active` the rest of the time.
 *
 * The Electron shell replaces this with `powerMonitor.getSystemIdleTime()`,
 * which sees every application, and the browser extension uses `chrome.idle`.
 * Those are the detectors that can honestly answer the question; this one is a
 * conservative fallback.
