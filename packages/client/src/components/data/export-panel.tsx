/**
 * Everything out, in one click.
 *
 * Two formats because they answer different questions. The JSON carries the
 * whole workspace — archived catalog entries, colors, project rates and
 * budgets, workspace settings, the caller's own pinned quick starts, and the
 * issued invoices for reference — and is what this app's own importer reads
 * back. The CSV carries what a spreadsheet can hold, in the exact column
 * shape the importer recognises, so editing history in a spreadsheet and
 * importing it back is a supported round trip rather than a lucky one.
 *
 * The panel asks the server what the download WOULD be before building it
 * (`data.exportInfo`), because both things worth saying are things the file
 * itself says too late: that it is above the cap the export refuses at, and
 * that its rates were blanked because this member may not see other members'
 * money. A backup nobody was told was partial is indistinguishable from a
 * complete one until the day it is restored.
