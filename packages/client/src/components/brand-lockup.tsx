/**
 * The mark plus the wordmark, for the pages that have no app chrome around
 * them to say what this is — sign-in, sign-up, password reset.
 *
 * The wordmark is real HTML text, not the SVG `<text>` that
 * `public/brand/logo-lockup.svg` uses. That file has to carry its own type
 * because it is consumed standalone (a README, an email); in the app there is
 * a font stack and a type scale already, and using them means the wordmark
 * matches the headings beside it, hinting and all, and stays selectable and
 * searchable. So the SVG asset and this component are two renderings of one
 * lockup rather than one importing the other.
 *
 * "time" takes the brand indigo via `--brand`, which lifts to #818CF8 in dark
 * mode exactly as the SVG assets do. Not `--primary`: that token is a neutral
 * in this palette.
