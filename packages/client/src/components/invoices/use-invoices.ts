 * than accepted from the client, and creating it stamps `invoiceId` on every
 * entry it bills. A row painted before the server answered would be a
 * document with a number nobody issued, and rolling it back after the fact
 * would leave the user unsure whether a customer had been billed. Every write
 * here waits for the real answer and then invalidates.
