/**
 * The rules that decide what editing one entry actually writes.
 *
 * These lived inside `entry-edit-dialog.tsx`, reachable only through a DOM,
 * which made them both untestable and re-implementable — and they are the
 * subtlest correctness rules in the app. They are pure functions here, with a
 * hook on top that holds the buffered state, so any other edit surface (a
 * phone sheet, a popover) inherits them instead of writing them again.
 *
 * Four rules, each of which destroys data when it is got wrong:
 *
 * - **Re-anchoring a date happens in the ENTRY's zone, not the editor's.**
 *   Moving "23:30 Berlin" to another day must keep it at 23:30 Berlin even
 *   when the person editing is in Tokyo. `withDayInZone` does exactly that;
 *   doing the arithmetic in local time silently shifts the entry by the offset
 *   between the two zones.
 * - **Moving the start day carries the end with it**, by the same delta, so
 *   the entry keeps its length instead of silently stretching across the gap.
 * - **A midnight-crossing end rolls forward rather than clamping.** 23:30 to
 *   00:30 is an hour of work; clamping to start + 1 minute threw it away.
 * - **A running entry keeps running.** `end` stays `null` unless the entry
 *   already had one, so saving a description on a live timer cannot stop it.
