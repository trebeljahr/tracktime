 * Surface the runaway-timer guard's verdict and let the person answer it.
 *
 * The guard itself runs on the server — see `services/runaway.ts` for why it
 * cannot live in a client. This hook is only the mouth: it watches the entry
 * list for a mark the person has not answered yet, and raises the same kind of
 * prompt the idle and sub-minute cases raise.
 *
 * It reads the LIST rather than `entries.current`, because a marked entry is
 * often no longer the running one: the `cap` and `stop` behaviours both end
 * it. Watching only the running entry would show the prompt for the behaviour
 * that changes nothing and hide it for the two that do.
 *
 * The query here is the same react-query subscription the entry list already
 * holds, so this costs no extra request.
