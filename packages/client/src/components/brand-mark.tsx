/**
 * The tracktime mark.
 *
 * Inlined rather than an `<img src="/brand/mark-tile.svg">` so it paints with
 * the first render instead of after a second request — it sits in the sidebar
 * header, which is above the fold on every screen.
 *
 * Kept in step with `public/brand/mark-tile.svg`, `src/app/icon.svg`, and the
 * bitmaps `pnpm run icons:brand` derives from the same file for the browser
 * extension, Raycast, desktop and mobile. Change one, change all of them —
 * the point of the mark is that the pinned toolbar button, the menu bar item
 * and this header are recognisably one app.
 *
 * The tile variant rather than the bare timer arc: the arc's track ring is a
 * neutral grey that needs a page background to read against, and the mark
 * appears here at 20px next to the wordmark, where the indigo ground is what
 * makes it legible at all.
