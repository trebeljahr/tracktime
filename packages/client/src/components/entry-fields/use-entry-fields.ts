 * Every field commits the moment it changes, except the description: it is
 * typed rather than picked, and a write per keystroke would put a mutation
 * (and a history step) behind every letter. It commits on blur or Enter
 * instead, which is why this returns a `commitDescription` for the caller to
 * hand to the editor.
 *
 * The local copy exists only so the description has somewhere to be while it
 * is being typed and so the pickers stay responsive ahead of the server; it is
 * reseeded whenever the entry itself changes, so an edit made on another
 * device — or a drag on the same one — is adopted rather than overwritten.
