 * The popup's copy of the account's theme.

 * The preference itself is synced — it arrives on every {@link BackgroundState}
 * snapshot, so choosing dark in the web app darkens this popup too. What lives
 * here is only the local cache and the DOM plumbing, and the cache is what
 * makes it usable: the popup is destroyed on every close and rebuilt on every
 * open, so painting the light theme first and correcting it when the worker
 * answers would flash white in a dark browser several times a day.
 *
 * `localStorage` rather than `chrome.storage`, and that is the whole point —
 * it is synchronous, so the class is on `<html>` before React's first render.
 * The extension popup has its own origin, so nothing else can see it.
