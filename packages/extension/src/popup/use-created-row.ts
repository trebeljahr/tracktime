/**
 * Select the catalog row that a "Create X" just made, once it arrives.
 *
 * Creating a project, task or tag from inside a picker used to create it and
 * stop there: the row appeared in the dropdown and the field it was created
 * from stayed empty, so every new tag had to be picked a second time — and a
 * tag created mid-timer was silently not on the entry at all.
 *
 * Selecting it at the call site is not possible. The worker answers a create
 * with a whole snapshot rather than with the row, so there is no id to select;
 * and the snapshot is applied by a `setState` that has not necessarily been
 * rendered by the time the awaited promise resolves, so reading the fresh list
 * straight after the await is a race. Waiting for the row to APPEAR in props
 * is the version that cannot race — it runs on the render that actually has it.
 *
 * Matching on the name is what makes that work, and is safe: every one of
 * these names is unique per workspace server-side, or the create that just
 * succeeded would have been refused.
