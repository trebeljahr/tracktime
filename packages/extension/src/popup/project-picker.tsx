/**
 * Pick a project, or make one — including the client it is filed under.
 *
 * Two fields, so it cannot be done from inside the picker the way a tag or a
 * task can: naming the project is step one, filing it under a client is step
 * two, and the second step is where a client can be created too. The panel
 * replaces the picker rather than sitting beside it, because at 380px there is
 * no beside.
 *
 * Shared by the tracker's composer and both entry forms. Reaching for a
 * project that does not exist yet is the ordinary case at the start of a piece
 * of work, and it is no less ordinary when the work is being logged after the
 * fact — being sent to the web app for it defeats a toolbar button either way.
