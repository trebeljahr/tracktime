 * Everything signed in as you, and the ways to sign one of them out.
 *
 * The list is fetched when the section is opened and after every successful
 * revoke — never by the three-second poll. Who is signed in does not have to
 * be right to the second, and putting `devices.list` on the snapshot's
 * critical path would cost a round trip every three seconds for a panel that
 * is closed almost always.
 *
 * The current session's row is deliberately NOT a revoke. Revoking it kills
 * the bearer token while the worker still holds a session record, so the popup
 * would keep rendering as signed in against a dead credential — so that row's
 * button runs the ordinary sign-out, which clears the record too. The worker
 * refuses a current session id as well, so a UI regression cannot reach the
 * server.
