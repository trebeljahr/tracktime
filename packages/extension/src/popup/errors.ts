/**
 * Turn a {@link BackgroundResponse} failure into something a user can act on.
 *
 * The worker forwards core's `AuthError.code` untouched, and those codes are
 * written for programs: "NO_SESSION_TOKEN" tells a developer the server is
 * missing the bearer plugin and tells a user nothing at all. Three cases in
 * particular have to land, because each has a different fix:
 *
 *   - bad credentials      → retype the password
 *   - unreachable server   → fix the API URL, or start the server
 *   - no session token     → the server is wrong, not the password; retrying
 *                            forever is the failure mode to avoid here
 *
 * Anything unrecognised falls through to the worker's own message rather than
 * a generic apology, so a new server-side code still says something true.
