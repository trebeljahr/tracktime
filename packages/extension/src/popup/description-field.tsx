 * The description input, with what you have called work before hanging under

 *
 * One component rather than three, because all three surfaces that name an
 * entry — the tracker's composer, the manual create form and the entry editor
 * — need the same behaviours, and they are fiddly enough that a second copy
 * drifts: commit when the field is left rather than on every keystroke, revert
 * on Escape without the blur it causes saving the abandoned text, and now the
 * suggestion list.
 *
 * Controlled, deliberately. Each caller already owns when its text may be
 * replaced — the tracker re-seeds only when the running timer's identity
 * changes, the entry form when a different entry is loaded — and a second copy
 * of the text in here would need the same rule written a second time, where it
 * could disagree.
 *
 * Not built out of {@link Combobox}. That control's value IS one of its
 * options and its input is a search box for them; this one's value is free
 * text that a list merely offers to complete. Bending one into the other would
 * mean a picker that has to accept anything typed into it, which is most of
 * what a picker does removed.
