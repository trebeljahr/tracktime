/**
 * The idle watcher's memory, and nothing else.
 *
 * Split from `./idle` on purpose. The detector has to call `startTimer` /
 * `stopTimer` to act on a decision, while `timer.ts` has to report back which
 * entry this worker opened — pointing both at one module would be an import
 * cycle. Everything here depends on `chrome.storage` alone.
 *
 * Persistence is not an optimisation. MV3 evicts the worker after about 30
 * seconds and revives it by re-evaluating the module, so a watcher that kept
 * ownership in a closure would wake believing it had never started anything,
 * fail the ownership rule forever, and silently never act.
