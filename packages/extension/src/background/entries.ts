/**
 * The past-entry surface: a bounded window of finished entries, and the three
 * mutations that can change one.
 *
 * Shaped exactly like {@link ./timer}: one input object per mutation, the queue
 * drained before anything goes out live, and a fall to `enqueueOffline` only
 * when the request never reached the server. What is new here is the overlay.
 * `rememberOptimisticRunning` models a single entry — the running one — because
 * that was the only entry this extension could change; a queued edit or delete
 * of a *past* row needs a store that can hold several, and one that survives
 * eviction, or a revived worker repaints the pre-edit values while the mutation
 * is still waiting to be sent.
 *
 * The window is fixed at {@link ENTRY_WINDOW_DAYS} days and capped at
 * {@link ENTRY_MAX_ROWS} rows, matching Raycast rather than the web app's
 * sentinel range: a 380px list with no filter and no search should not be able
 * to grow without limit, and the cap is stated on screen so it reads as a
 * decision rather than a bug.
