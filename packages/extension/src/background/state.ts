/**
 * Building the {@link BackgroundState} snapshot the popup renders.
 *
 * Snapshots are always whole. The popup is destroyed every time it closes, so
 * it has no baseline to merge a partial update onto — a half-applied patch
 * would be indistinguishable from a stale one.
 *
 * Two failure modes are handled differently on purpose. A 401 means the token
 * is dead and the popup must be told to show its sign-in form. Anything else —
 * realistically, the network being off — falls back to whatever the worker
 * last knew, because a popup showing a stale running timer is far more useful
 * than one showing an error.
