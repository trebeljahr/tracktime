 * work, so a list narrowed locally would answer "no match" for a description
 * the user has certainly typed before — it simply was not among the rows the
 * unfiltered call happened to return. Pushing the query down means the regex
 * runs against the whole window.
 *
 * Sibling of `favorites.ts`'s recents rather than a mode of it. A recent is
 * keyed on the whole (description, project, task, billable) combination and
 * answers "resume this job"; a suggestion is keyed on the description alone
 * and answers "you have called work this before". One list cannot do both
 * without either repeating a name once per project it was ever filed under, or
 * hiding the project it usually belongs to.
