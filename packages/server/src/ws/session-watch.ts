 * every sync event for that user. A revoked device that keeps streaming your
 * timers is a revocation hole, not a cosmetic one.
 *
 * Re-checking on a timer, rather than reacting to a revoke event, is the
 * choice here because revocation is not the only way a session stops
 * existing: it also expires, it is deleted by `revokeOtherSessions`, and it
 * can be removed straight out of the database (which is exactly how this was
 * demonstrated). A periodic re-check catches all of those with one rule; an
 * event only catches the one path that remembers to publish it.
