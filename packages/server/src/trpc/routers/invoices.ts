// IMPLEMENTED BY: invoicing agent
//
// An invoice turns billable time for ONE client over ONE date range into a
// document. Two rules make the rest of the design fall out:
//
//  - It is a SNAPSHOT. Rates, currency, the client's name and the billed
//    seconds are copied onto the document at creation, so nothing that
//    happens afterwards can rewrite a document already sent to a customer.
//  - Time is billed ONCE. `Invoice.entryIds` is the source of truth and
//    `TimeEntry.invoiceId` its denormalized index; `preview` and `create`
//    only ever consider entries with `invoiceId: null`, and `remove` must
//    clear the back-reference so the time becomes billable again.
//
// The arithmetic — which entries qualify, how they roll into lines, what the
// totals are, which status changes are legal — lives in exported pure
// functions at the top of this file. They have no database and no tRPC in
// them so `tests/invoices.test.ts` can pin the rules that matter without
// standing up Mongo.
