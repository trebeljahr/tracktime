// Budget/estimate roll-ups for projects.

// target — so unlike the reports it clips to no range. What it does share with
// the reports is the money math: earnings come from `computeBudgetProgress`,
// which in turn defers to `entryAmount`/`sumAmounts` and the entry's own rate
// snapshot. Nothing here recomputes earnings from a project's current rate.
