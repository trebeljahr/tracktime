// Minting, listing and revoking the credentials for the public REST API.
//
// Everything here is `workspaceProcedure`: a token belongs to one workspace,
// and the workspace it belongs to is the one the caller is currently resolved
// into — never one named on the input body.
//
// The workspace is only half the rule, and the half that was missing was the
// expensive one. WITHIN a workspace, a credential belongs to the person who
// minted it: every query here is scoped by `userId: ctx.user.id` as well as
// by the workspace, so a member neither sees nor can revoke a colleague's
// token. Scoping by workspace alone listed every member's token names and
// prefixes to everyone, and let any member kill a colleague's running
// integration — an availability attack that leaves no trace beyond a
// timestamp on somebody else's row.
//
// There is deliberately NO admin override, and no workspace-wide list:
//
//  - The need it would serve — "revoke the token of someone who left" — is
//    already served, and served better, by removing their membership.
//    `authenticateApiToken` resolves live membership on every request and
//    answers 401 `no_membership` without one, so a departed member's tokens
//    are dead the moment they are removed, whether or not anyone revokes
//    them one by one.
//  - Buying the override would cost a workspace-wide read, and a listed
//    token a caller does not own would have to be marked as foreign on the
//    wire for the UI not to offer actions the server refuses. No such flag
//    exists on `ApiTokenSummary`, and inventing an unmarked one is how a
//    settings screen ends up lying about whose credential a row is.
