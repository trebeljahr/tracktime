// Managing the endpoints a workspace pushes events to.
//
// Everything here is `workspaceProcedure`. Three rules this file exists to
// enforce, all of which fail silently if broken:
//
//  - The signing secret is returned exactly ONCE, from `create`. Nothing else
//    can read it back: `toClientWebhookSubscription` builds a fresh object
//    rather than spreading the document, so the field is absent by
//    construction rather than by remembering to delete it.
//  - Every URL goes through `assertDeliverableUrl` — at create AND at update.
//    Validating only on create would let an endpoint be pointed at a loopback
//    address one edit later.
//  - A subscription is managed by the member who created it, and by nobody
//    else in the workspace. Every query here carries `createdBy: ctx.user.id`
//    beside the workspace id; a colleague's subscription answers NOT_FOUND,
//    the same way any id outside a caller's reach does.
//
// That third rule is not tidiness, it is the whole permission model:
// deliveries are projected against `subscription.createdBy`'s LIVE
// visibility (`services/webhooks/delivery.ts`), so an editable url on
// somebody else's subscription is an exfiltration primitive rather than an
// edit. In a workspace where A may see other people's money and B may not, B
// repointing A's subscription at a host B controls receives payloads
// projected against A — money B was refused, delivered to B, signed by us,
// with A's name on the row. `url` is the field that turns the projection into
// a channel, so it is the field this rule exists for; the rest of the update
// is scoped the same way because there is no reason for it not to be.
//
// There is deliberately no admin override and no workspace-wide list. A
// webhook URL frequently IS a credential — the token lives in the path of
// the endpoint it posts to — so listing a colleague's subscription hands over
// their secret in the name of oversight. Nor is one needed for cleanup: when
// a creator leaves the workspace, `ownerVisibility` finds no membership and
// every delivery is skipped, so the subscription stops pushing anything
// without anyone touching it.
