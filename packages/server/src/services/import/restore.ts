// What is NOT here is as deliberate as what is: invoices are export-only (see
// `WorkspaceExportInvoice` for the four reasons), and the per-user half of
// settings is keyed by userId rather than workspaceId, so a workspace file
// writing it would reconfigure the importer in every OTHER workspace too.

 *    and leave the row in an order nobody chose.
 *  - Capped at {@link MAX_FAVORITES}, the same ceiling the router enforces.
 *    The overflow is counted rather than written, so the import can say the
 *    row was full instead of silently exceeding a limit.
 *
 * A pin whose project name does not resolve in the destination is kept with
 * `projectId: null` rather than dropped: "the thing I do every morning" with
 * no project is a perfectly good pin, and dropping it loses a row the user
 * would never know had been in the file.
