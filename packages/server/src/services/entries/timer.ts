/**
 * How far a running-timer lookup may reach.

 * Two different principals ask "what is running?", and the honest answer is
 * not the same for both:
 *
 *  - `person` — a cookie or bearer SESSION. The principal IS the human, who
 *    belongs to every workspace their one running timer could be in, so "show
 *    me / stop whatever I have running" means exactly that, wherever it lives.
 *    That is what the extension badge and the Raycast menu bar render, and it
 *    is why everything else in this file is author-scoped.
 *  - `workspace` — an API TOKEN. The principal is the TOKEN, bound to one
 *    workspace and typically handed to somebody who is not the person: a
 *    contractor's integration, say. A workspace-A token that read the person's
 *    timer running in workspace B would hand out another client's description
 *    and hourly rate, and stopping it would end that client's billable time and
 *    fire `entry.stopped` webhooks into a workspace this token cannot even
 *    name — `requireApiToken` already answers 400 workspace-not-addressable to
 *    a request that tries to name one.
 *
 * The parameter is REQUIRED wherever it appears, and deliberately has no
 * default. A default could only be `person`, the permissive value, and the
 * failure this type exists to prevent is precisely a new call site crossing
 * workspaces by saying nothing at all. Forgetting it is a compile error.
