 * The parts of an entry an invoice's line items are computed from.
 *
 * `description` and `tagIds` are deliberately absent: neither reaches a line
 * item, so relabelling or re-tagging billed time is harmless and stays allowed.
 * Everything listed here does reach one — changing it behind an issued invoice
 * would leave that invoice claiming hours, a rate or a project the underlying
 * time no longer has, with nothing on screen to say the two had diverged.

/**
 * Why an edit to an already-invoiced entry must be refused, or `null` when it
 * is fine to proceed.
 *
 * `Invoice.entryIds` and `TimeEntry.invoiceId` keep the same time from being
 * billed twice, but nothing stopped the billed time itself from moving after
 * the fact. An invoice is a record of what was billed, so the entry is frozen
 * in the ways the invoice depends on rather than the invoice being silently
 * recomputed underneath the customer who already received it.
 *
 * Exported for the unit tests — the rule is worth pinning independently of a
 * database.
