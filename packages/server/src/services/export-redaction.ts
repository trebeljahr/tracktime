// Money on the way out of the workspace.
//
// An export is a BULK door onto the same rows a report serves a page at a
// time, and it is the only door that currently answers the money question at
// all. `buildMatchConditions` in reports.ts decides WHICH entries a member
// sees (`canViewOthersTime`) and deliberately leaves the amounts on them
// alone — see the comment there: zeroing those is Stage 5. `settings.get`,
// `projects.list` and `invoices.list` are open the same way.
//
// So this closes ONE door, and a reader must not take it for the whole
// building: while those siblings are open, a member refused rates here can
// still read them from an ordinary query. What this module buys today is that
// the BULK path — one click, every row, a file that leaves the machine — is
// not the easy one, and that the guarantee is written once so the two export
// formats cannot come to disagree about it.
//
// Pure on purpose — no database, no request. The export builder assembles the
// document, this decides what of it the caller may keep, and the CSV door is
// built from the already-redacted document rather than redacting a second
// time. Two implementations of one rule is how the two doors come to disagree.

/**
 * Whether the caller keeps ANY of the money in the export.
 *
 * ONE predicate, deliberately, and with no author-scope escape hatch. The
 * tempting second rule — "scoped to their own rows, so their own rates are
 * their own money" — is false about this format: an entry's `hourlyRate` is
 * not a figure the author chose, it is the PROJECT rate card copied onto the
 * row by `resolveHourlyRate`, falling back to `settings.defaultHourlyRate`.
 * A document that blanks `projects[].hourlyRate` and then hands the same
 * number back on `entries[].hourlyRate` beside its `projectName` has
 * published exactly what it just redacted, and one billable second booked
 * against each project in `projects.list` enumerates the rest of the card.
 *
 * The other half — project budgets, the workspace default rate, every figure
 * on an invoice — was never member-scoped and never can be: a project's rate
 * states what everybody billing it earns, and an invoice line merges whoever's
 * hours were billed into one amount.

/**
 * Strip every money-bearing field the caller may not see.
 *
 * Redacts to `null`, NEVER to `0`. A rate is a stored value, not a computed
 * amount: `0` is a real number to both parsers (`parseAmount("0")`, and the
 * `typeof === "number"` check on JSON entries), and on commit a row's own `0`
 * WINS over the destination rate card because `??` falls through on null and
 * not on zero — so a `0`-redacted export re-imports as history permanently
 * priced at nothing, with no error anywhere along the way. `null` is what an
 * absent rate already parses to, so a redacted file re-prices from the
 * destination workspace's own rate card, exactly like any rate-less file.
 *
 * `currency` is deliberately NOT redacted, here or in the CSV. A currency
 * code is the workspace's unit rather than anybody's earnings, reports hand
 * it to every member already, and blanking it would break the round trip's
 * Currency column for no confidentiality gain. `budgetCurrency` is the one
 * exception, and only because it is half of a pair: with its amount gone it
 * describes nothing, so the two go together.
 *
 * Every money field this format grows must be listed HERE, not merely typed
 * `number | null`. `settings.defaultHourlyRate` and the invoice figures are
 * the widest of them — one states what unpriced work is worth across the
 * whole workspace, the other what customers were actually charged.
