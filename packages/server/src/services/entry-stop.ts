 * see `stopRunningEntry`. Its rate snapshot must come from ITS workspace.
 *
 * The `end: null` in the filter is the whole concurrency story, and it is what
 * makes "whichever closes the entry first wins" true for free: the runaway
 * guard and an idle watcher racing on the same entry cannot both succeed,
 * because the loser's filter no longer matches.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the entry was already stopped by someone else.

 * `runaway` is written in the same update as the stop, so a cap and the record
 * that explains it can never land apart.
