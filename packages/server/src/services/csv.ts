/**
 * RFC 4180 CSV serialization for report exports.
 *
 * Three things spreadsheets care about that a naive `join(",")` gets wrong:
 *  - quoting (a field containing `,` `"` CR or LF must be quoted, inner
 *    quotes doubled),
 *  - CRLF line endings,
 *  - a leading UTF-8 BOM, without which Excel decodes the file as the
 *    system codepage and mangles every non-ASCII project name.
 *
 * It also defuses CSV injection: a text field starting with `=`, `+`, `-`
 * or `@` is read as a formula by Excel/Sheets, so those get a leading
 * apostrophe. Numbers are emitted verbatim — they are produced by us, never
 * by user input, and quoting a negative number would break `SUM()`.
