 * Fan an event out to every enabled subscription that asked for it.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget with a swallowed catch, exactly like `publishSync`, and for
 * the same reason: an integration is a side effect of a mutation, never a
 * precondition of it. A webhook table that is down must not make stopping a
 * timer fail. NEVER await this into a mutation's failure path.
 *
 * The FULL, unprojected envelope is stored. The visibility projection happens
 * at SEND time against the subscription owner's live view, so a permission
 * change between enqueue and send is honoured rather than frozen in here.
