 * Which transport a given environment selects, in a fixed order:

 *                  typed into SMTP_HOST is an explicit choice, and silently
 *                  preferring a Listmonk left over from an earlier setup
 *                  would send mail through a service the operator thought
 *                  they had replaced.
 *   2. Listmonk  — only when its whole set is present. A partial Listmonk
 *                  config is a misconfiguration, not a transport; treating
 *                  it as one turns every send into a 401 at delivery time.
 *   3. console   — no mail provider at all. Sends are logged, not delivered,
 *                  which is right for local dev and is the state a fresh
 *                  self-host boots in.
 *
 * Note that EMAIL_FROM does NOT participate: an SMTP host with no From
 * address must still select SMTP and then fail loudly at send time, because
 * falling back to console logging would look like "email is not configured"
 * to an operator who plainly configured it.
