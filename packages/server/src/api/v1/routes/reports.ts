// projection of a total: stripping the rate off the rows underneath it leaves
// a number that still looks like earnings and is now wrong, and zeroing it
// leaves a page of honest-looking zeros that a spreadsheet will happily sum.
//
// So this layer REFUSES instead. See `requireMoneyVisibility` for exactly
// when, and why the common case is still allowed.

/**
 * When a report may be served.
 *
 * Two of the three combinations are fine and the third is refused:
 *
 *  - `canViewOthersTime` off — the rows are author-only whatever the money
 *    flag says, so every amount in the report is the caller's own earnings.
 *    Allowed.
 *  - both on — the caller may see colleagues' time AND their money. Allowed.
 *  - time on, money off — the report would span colleagues' entries while the
 *    caller may not see what they are worth. There is no honest number to put
 *    in `totalAmount`, so the request is refused rather than answered wrongly.
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT change the tRPC path. `canViewOthersMoney` has no
 * enforcement in `reports.ts` today; fixing that is a separate change with its
 * own blast radius. What this must not do is EXTEND the gap onto a brand-new
 * surface, which is what serving it here unfiltered would be.
 *
 * Exported because `GET /entries` serves rows carrying the same `amount` and
 * therefore owes the same answer — one predicate and one wording, so the two
 * surfaces cannot come to disagree about when money may be shown.
