// Every handler is a thin shell: parse with the SAME zod schema the tRPC
// procedure uses, build a `WorkspaceScope` from the token, call the SAME
// extracted service function, project the result for what this token may see.
// No business rule is re-implemented here — that is the point of the layer.
// The services already publish the ws/sync events and enqueue the webhook
// deliveries, so a REST mutation moves the web app exactly as a tRPC one does.
