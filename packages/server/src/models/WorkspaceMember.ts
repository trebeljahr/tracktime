// App-owned membership: who is in a workspace, and what they may see.
//
// This is deliberately a SIBLING of better-auth's `member` collection, not a
// set of additional fields on it. The plugin owns the shape of its own
// collections across upgrades; a billing rate and a money-visibility flag are
// business data and must not depend on that.
//
// better-auth's `member` remains the source of truth for `role` (it is what
// the plugin's own invite/remove endpoints write). This record mirrors the
// role for convenience and owns everything the plugin does not model.
