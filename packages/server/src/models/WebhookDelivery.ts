// One attempt-tracked push of one event to one subscription.
//
// The FULL envelope is stored on the row rather than a reference to whatever
// the entry looks like now: a delivery describes what happened at the moment
// it happened, and re-reading the entry at send time would push the state
// after three later edits under the timestamp of the first.
//
// The visibility projection is NOT applied here — it happens at send time,
// against the subscription owner's live-and-narrowed visibility, so a
// permission change between enqueue and send is honoured.
//
// `_id` is assigned by the emitter, not by the insert: it is the delivery id
// the envelope and the `X-Tracktime-Delivery` header carry, so it has to exist
// before the row does.
