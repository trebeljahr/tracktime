// The guard against the failure mode this whole re-architecture exists to
// prevent: a new router that scopes its queries by nothing.
//
// Authorization used to be a `{ ownerId }` literal repeated at ~180 query
// sites — a convention enforced by nothing. A resolver that forgot it did not
// throw; it returned somebody else's rows. Now there is exactly one way to be
// scoped (`workspaceProcedure`), and this test fails the build when a router
// does not use it.
//
// Deliberately a SOURCE-level assertion rather than a runtime one: it needs no
// database, no session and no tRPC internals, so it keeps working across
// upgrades and cannot itself be broken by a mocking mistake.
