// The export is a bulk door: one call hands over every row a report would
// serve a page at a time. So these tests do NOT check a list of known money
// fields — they WALK the produced document and fail on any money-named value
// that survived. A field added to the export later without a redaction rule
// fails here rather than shipping as a silent disclosure.
//
// The walk only catches a new field if the fixture HOLDS one, and that is the
// half a hand-written literal gets wrong: every section this format has grown
// so far arrived optional (`settings?`, `favorites?`, `invoices?`), so an
// optional money field typechecks against a fixture that never mentions it and
// the walker is never pointed at it. The fixture is therefore typed
// `Required<...>` at every level — see {@link ExhaustiveExport}. A new field,
// optional or not, fails to compile until it is filled in here, and then fails
// the walk until it is redacted there.
