// workspace-not-addressable to a request that so much as names another — but
// the running-timer helpers are author-scoped, because for a SESSION the
// principal is the person and "stop whatever I have running" means wherever it
// runs. Handed to a token, that same query reads and stops a timer in a
// workspace the token was never issued for: another client's description and
// hourly rate out of `GET /entries/current`, their billable time ended and
// `entry.stopped` webhooks fired into their workspace out of `POST
// /entries/stop`.
//
// `TimerReach` is the distinction between the two principals, and these tests
