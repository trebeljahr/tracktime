// The one thing between an unprojected envelope and somebody else's money.
//
// A webhook is a standing grant, so the projection is the ONLY place the
// permission question gets re-asked after the subscription was created. If it
// is wrong, nothing else in the pipeline notices: the delivery succeeds, the
// receiver stores the rate, and the leak is discovered when somebody reads
// their integration's database months later.
//
// Every case here is therefore stated from the negative side — what must NOT
// be on the wire — rather than from the happy path.
