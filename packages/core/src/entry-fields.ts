/**
 * What every client lets you say about a block of time.
 *
 * Five things decide what an entry *is* — its description, its project, its
 * task, its tags and whether it is billable — and all five are settable from
 * every surface that creates or edits one: the tracker bar, the manual dialog,
 * an entry row, the calendar, the browser extension popup, the Raycast forms.
 * They live here rather than in any one of those because the RULES that hold
 * between them are not per-surface, and every place that reimplemented them
 * got at least one wrong.
 *
 * Client is deliberately absent, and is not a sixth field. An entry has no
 * client column: a client owns projects, a project owns tasks, and an entry
 * points at a project. Clients are therefore SHOWN everywhere (grouping the
 * project list, labelling the chosen project) and CHOSEN nowhere — picking one
 * directly would either be a filter wearing a field's clothes, or a second
 * source of truth that can disagree with the project's own client.
 *
 * Framework-free, like the rest of core — no React, no DOM, no tRPC.
