/**
 * What this install last did to the timer, remembered locally.
 *
 * Every client renders "is a timer running" from a snapshot it fetched over
 * the network, and a snapshot is only ever true as of the moment it was
 * fetched. That is fine for a surface that refetches on demand, and wrong for
 * one that keeps painting between fetches — a macOS menu bar item, a tray
 * icon, a widget. Those keep a stopped timer ticking until something makes
 * them look again, and the user is left staring at seconds accumulating on an
 * entry that ended.
 *
 * The echo is the missing half: a mutation writes down what it just did, in
 * storage every surface of that install can read, without a round trip. A
 * snapshot fetched BEFORE the echo loses to it, so a stop performed on this
 * machine is visible to every one of its surfaces immediately, whether or not
 * the refetch has landed — or ever lands.
 *
 * It expires by construction rather than by a TTL: the next successful fetch
 * carries a later `fetchedAt` than the echo, and from that instant the echo
 * can no longer win. So a timer started on another device is never masked by
 * a stale local record of a stop.
