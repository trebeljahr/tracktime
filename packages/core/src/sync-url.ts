 * Where the sync socket lives, derived from whatever API base URL a client was

/**
 * `wss://example.com/api/ws` from `https://example.com`. With no
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` the socket is same-origin, which is what the local
 * dev proxy and single-origin deployments want.
 *
 * The socket sits UNDER `/api` deliberately: the server mounts everything it
 * owns at that prefix, so `https://api.trackyourtime.dev` as the base yields
 * `wss://api.trackyourtime.dev/api/ws`. The doubled-looking segment is the
 * mount, not a stray path in the base URL. Keeping one prefix means one
 * routing rule at the proxy — a socket at `/ws` would need its own, and a
 * rule nobody remembers to add is a client that reconnects forever while
 * every HTTP request succeeds.
 *
 * The server accepts `/ws` as well (`ws/handler.ts`), so a client built before
 * this still connects wherever `/ws` is still routed.
