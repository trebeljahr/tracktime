/**
 * Starting a quick start, and deciding which ones to show.
 *
 * Every client — the web tracker, the extension's service worker, the Raycast
 * commands — turns a favorite or a recent into a timer by calling
 * {@link buildQuickStartInput} and handing the result to `entries.start`. That
 * is the same input shape the tracker's Start button builds and the same shape
 * the offline queue replays, which is what makes "start from a favorite" work
 * offline for free: it is not a special case, it is a start.
 *
 * Framework-free, like the rest of core — no React, no DOM, no tRPC.
