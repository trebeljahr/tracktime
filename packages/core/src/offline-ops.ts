/**
 * The op/payload contract for entry mutations that were queued offline.
 *
 * `offline-queue.ts` stores opaque rows; this module is what gives those rows
 * meaning. It lives in core rather than the web client because every client
 * that can mutate entries — the web app, the extension's service worker, the
 * Raycast client — must agree on the op names and payload shapes, or one of
 * them writes rows another cannot replay. Everything here is pure: no window,
 * no React, no tRPC. The replay runner that actually calls the API stays with
 * whichever client owns the API binding.
