/**
 * Idle detection: the decision, not the detector.
 *
 * Every client detects idleness its own way — `chrome.idle` in the extension's
 * service worker, `powerMonitor.getSystemIdleTime()` in the Electron shell, DOM
 * input events in the web app — and they all feed the same machine here, which
 * decides what should happen to the running timer. Nothing in this file touches
 * a DOM, a clock or a network: the caller supplies `atMs`, the running entry
 * and the resolved settings, and gets back a plan to execute.
 *
 * ── The cross-device rule ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The timer is one thing shared by every device; idleness is a property of one
 * device. A laptop closing its lid says nothing about whether the person is
 * working — they may well be at the desktop, which is the entire reason the
 * sync exists. So a device may act on its own idle signal only when it can
 * claim the running entry, which takes two things:
 *
 *  1. **It opened the entry.** `noteLocalStart(id)` records what this device
 *     started; a device that merely *sees* a running entry over sync never
 *     touches it. This alone kills the headline bug — a second machine falling
 *     asleep cannot pause a timer it did not start.
 *
 *  2. **Nothing has proved the person alive since.** Any sync event from a
 *     different origin means some other device just did something, so the
 *     person was at a keyboard then. `noteRemoteActivity(atMs)` moves the idle
 *     floor forward to that instant rather than cancelling outright, so a
 *     person who works on the desktop for an hour and then genuinely stops is
 *     still measured — from their last sign of life, not from ours.
 *
 * The two rejected alternatives, for the record: *"act only on the device that
 * started it"* alone still pauses the timer when someone starts on the laptop
 * and moves to the desktop without touching the timer; *"require the idle
 * signal from every connected device"* is the most correct rule of all, but it
 * needs devices to broadcast presence, which means a new sync event and a
 * heartbeat on the wire for a case the two rules above already cover.
 *
 * ── Never destroy tracked time ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A truncation ends the entry where input stopped. It is clamped so the entry
 * always survives with at least a second on it: an entry that fell entirely
 * inside the idle span becomes a one-second row (which the existing sub-minute
 * discard toast then offers to clean up) rather than an impossible `end <=
 * start` or a delete. Deleting is never something detection does on its own.
