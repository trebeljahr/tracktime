 * Empty state shown by every view command when there is no session yet.
 *
 * Pairing is pushed from here rather than living in a command of its own: it
 * is the wall every command hits while signed out, so it belongs where the
 * user hits it — and a root-search entry for something you run once is surface
 * for nothing. Pushed rather than rendered inline because {@link SignIn} opens
 * the approval page in a browser as soon as it mounts, which is helpful when
 * asked for and rude when it happens because a list happened to load.
