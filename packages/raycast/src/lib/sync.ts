/**
 * The sync socket, for as long as Raycast keeps a command alive.
 *
 * Raycast is not a place a socket can live permanently — a view command dies
 * when it closes, and a menu bar command is unloaded the moment its first
 * render settles. But the states this extension most needs to be right about
 * are exactly the states where something IS alive: a view command open in
 * front of the user, and the menu bar item while it counts a running timer.
 * In both, a stop made in the web app, the browser extension or on another
 * machine should land now rather than on the next poll.
 *
 * When nothing is alive, the command's `interval` and `usePoll` still cover
 * it. This only ever narrows the window; it never becomes the sole path.
