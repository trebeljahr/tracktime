 *
 * ── Why no per-vendor importers ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every tracker exports the same handful of facts under slightly different
 * headers: what was worked on, for which project, when it started, and how
 * long it took. So the importer is written against COLUMN SHAPES, not against
 * products: the header row is matched to {@link ImportColumnRole}s by an alias
 * table, and the resulting {@link ImportShape} says which of the three
 * layouts the file uses. A file nobody anticipated still lands, and the user
 * can re-point any column by hand ({@link ImportColumnOverride}) when the
 * guess is wrong.
 *
 * Everything here is transport-level description of a file the user picked;
 * the parsing itself lives on the server so there is exactly one
 * implementation of it (`services/import/`).

 *  3. `status` of "sent" or "paid" asserts something that happened in the real

 * `entryIds` is therefore omitted entirely rather than exported as ids that
