/**
 * The runaway-timer guard: the policy values every package has to agree on,
 * and the pure decision the server evaluates against a running entry.
 *
 * This is NOT idle detection, and the two exist for different failures:
 *
 *  - Idle is "the person stopped typing". It is detected on a device, from a
 *    device's own input signal, and it needs a client to be awake and looking.
 *  - Runaway is "the timer started on Friday evening and it is Monday
 *    morning". The laptop was shut. No client was running. Nothing was there
 *    to detect anything.
 *
 * That difference is why the decision lives here rather than in
 * `@starter/core`: `@starter/core` is the clients' shared brain, and the case
 * this guard exists for is precisely the one where no client is running. The
 * server package imports `@starter/shared` and not `@starter/core`, so the
 * decision has to be reachable from here.
 *
 * The evaluation is pure — it takes two instants, the settings and whatever
 * the guard already recorded, and returns what to do. Everything that touches
 * Mongo or the socket is a thin shell around it on the server, which is what
 * makes every branch below testable by driving the clock instead of waiting.
