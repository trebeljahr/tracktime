/**
 * Per-project estimates and budgets.
 *
 * A budget is a *lifetime* target for one project: "this job was quoted at 80
 * hours / EUR 6,000". Progress against it is a roll-up of the project's own
 * entries, so this module owns no money math of its own — it defers to
 * `entryAmount` / `sumAmounts` in `rates.ts`, the same helpers the reports
 * use, because the per-entry rate snapshot rules are subtle and already
 * encoded once there.
 *
 * Two rules the callers depend on:
 *  - `null` and `0` are different targets. No estimate at all yields `null`
 *    ratios and a `"none"` status, never "0% of 0".
 *  - Money is never summed across currencies. Each entry snapshots the
 *    workspace currency it was tracked in, so spend is bucketed per currency
 *    and only the bucket matching the budget's own currency counts towards it.
 *    Anything else is reported through `foreignCurrencies` for the UI to
 *    explain rather than silently folded into the total.
