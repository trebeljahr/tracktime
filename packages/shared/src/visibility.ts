 *
 * - `progress` is DERIVED, and it derives from EVERY member's entries:
 *   `spentAmount` is aggregate colleague earnings, `trackedSec` aggregate
 *   colleague hours. It is the one project field that discloses other
 *   people's work, so it is the one that is withheld.
 * - `hourlyRate`, `budgetAmount` and `budgetCurrency` are workspace
 *   CONFIGURATION, not a colleague's money. The rate is the one the caller's
 *   OWN entries are already stamped with — it is on every row `/entries`
 *   hands them — and the budget is the target the job was sold at. Neither is
 *   derived from anybody else's work, so both stay.
 *
 * It takes BOTH flags because it mixes both dimensions. A caller with money
 * but not time still differences colleague hours out of `trackedSec`; a
 * caller with time but not money reads colleague earnings straight off
 * `spentAmount`. Either flag alone is a hole, so the rule is the conjunction.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THE RATE DEPENDS ON — and the sentence that used to be wrong
 * here. This block once said the rate is safe to ship "beside the entries it
 * prices", full stop, and that claim is what made a live leak look reviewed:
 * `spentAmount` is `hourlyRate x totalSec / 3600`, so shipping the rate next
 * to a WHOLE-WORKSPACE `totalSec` withheld nothing at all — one multiplication
 * rebuilt the number, and subtracting the caller's own total gave a
 * colleague's earnings. A withheld aggregate is only withheld if its FACTORS
 * are too. The rate stays because `rollupVisibility` below makes the total
 * beside it count the caller's OWN entries whenever the money is withheld; it
 * would have to go the day that stops being true.
 *
 * Withheld as `null`, never as zero: null is the shape's existing "no target
 * set" signal, which every client already renders as "no budget". A zeroed
 * progress renders as "0% of 4,000 spent" — a claim about money, and a false
 * one.

 * visibility where the two rules disagree — `canViewOthersTime: true,
 * canViewOthersMoney: false` — shipping both halves of the number it refuses:
 * `progress` came back null beside an unscoped `totalSec` and the project's
 * `hourlyRate`, and `hourlyRate x totalSec / 3600` is `spentAmount` exactly.
 * Per colleague, too, by subtracting the caller's own total. That visibility
 * is already judged too dangerous for money-bearing shapes elsewhere —
 * `requireMoneyVisibility` refuses `GET /entries` and every report for it —
 * and the catalog roll-up was the one surface still serving it.
 *
 * So the total is author-scoped whenever the money it prices is withheld. The
 * same narrowing is applied to the project, task AND tag roll-ups: a rule with
 * an exception is a rule nobody can check, and the tag roll-up is the widest
 * of the three (it totals the whole workspace's work per label).
