 * (description, project, task, billable) combinations the entry log already
 * holds. **Favorites** are explicit and pinned, so a weekly task does not fall
 * off the end of the recents list.
 *
 * Both collapse to a {@link QuickStart}, and that is the point: every client
 * starts one by handing those four fields to `entries.start`, exactly as the
 * tracker's Start button does. There is no "start a favorite" endpoint,
 * because a second start path would need its own billable defaulting, its own
 * rate snapshot and its own offline queueing — three chances to disagree with
